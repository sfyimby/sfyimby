				<p>Yesterday, the political rift in San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors erupted
into vitriol, with accusations of betrayal and backhanded deals flying back
and forth across the aisle. The soft divide between overtly liberal
politicians, colloquially referred to as “Moderates” and “Progressives,”
hardened into an iron curtain over police accountability. The majority faction
known as “Progressives” forced a vote combining a popular <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzbsC36--
LzqZ3dSanVTYml2RDQ/view?pref=2&amp;pli=1">ballot
measure</a> proposal for independent police
oversight with a more controversial measure to create a Public Advocate
office. <em>(Editor’s note: because the labels are informal, we will be
bracketing “moderate” and “progressive” appropriately throughout our
coverage.)</em></p>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>“This has nothing to do with police violence,” activist Edwin Lindo wrote in
an email. “These two have a private issue that is now being dealt with in the
public eye.”</p>

				<p>Supervisor Malia Cohen had <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/public-advocate-proposal-talks-erupt-name-
calling-supervisors/">previously been
critical</a> of “progressive” Supervisor David Campos’ proposal for a
ballot measure creating a Public Advocate office. Cohen, nominally a
“moderate,” had proposed a ballot measure to create a new department for
police accountability that had received unanimous support in the wake of
recent SFPD killings and Black Lives Matter protests.</p>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>Cohen’s measure would have revamped the Office of Citizen Complaints (OCC)
into a new structure, the Department of Police Accountability, which would be
independent of the Police Department. She cited the December 2015 police
shooting of Mario Woods, which was caught on video, as the impetus to “bring
back confidence in law enforcement.” Elaine Brown, a former leader in the
Black Panther Party, attended and spoke in favor of Cohen’s proposal, backed
by the group Justice For Mario Woods. She illustrated recent reform efforts as
evidence of “the resurrection of the spirit of the Black Panther Party.”</p>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>Members of the “progressive” faction eager to curb the power of Mayor Ed Lee
raised concerns on the day of voting that Cohen’s measure was flawed in
reserving leadership appointment for the mayor. The objections came as a
surprise to Supervisor Cohen, who had remained confident her measure had
enough support to be approved for the ballot.</p>

						</div>
						
						
				
    
  
    
				<p>After a motion introduced by Supervisor John Avalos, onlookers were audibly
shocked to see the “Progressive” faction, comprised of Supervisors Peskin,
Kim, Yee, Avalos, Campos, and Mar, vote to combine Cohen’s measure with
Campos’ Public Advocate proposal. Critics insisted that Cohen’s proposal would
suffer by being hamstrung to the less powerful office proposed by Campos.
Board President London Breed, respected on both sides for her stern
professionalism, sharply rebuked the board; Cohen, visibly livid, called the
majority of colleagues hypocrites. She immediately reiterated the sentiment on
Twitter.</p>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>“This is absolutely critical; we don’t have time,” Cohen insisted, referring
to the fact that the Public Advocate would not be elected until 2018 if
Campos’ measure were to pass.</p>

<div class="text-block">
	
	

  
    
  
    
				<p>For several months prior, Campos’ Public Advocate proposal had been criticized
as an effort to create a job for himself after he is termed out of the Board
of Supervisors. Creating a new elected office to support whistleblowers and
general complaints against city government, critics argued, was a waste of
money and a transparent effort to keep Supervisor Campos in city hall.</p>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>Though former Assemblymember Tom Ammiano
<a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Call-for-a
-public-advocate-in-SF-7247095.php">argued</a> that the office would in fact save the
city millions, critics felt vindicated when Supervisor Eric Mar, part of the
“progressive” majority faction, voted against the Public Advocate measure he
had sponsored in the Rules Committee. His dissent has been attributed to an
amendment that would prohibit elected officials from running for Public
Advocate until they had been out of public office for at least four years,
which would have disqualified Campos as a candidate. The amendment, introduced
by Cohen, drew Campos into a rage last week, when he accused her of protecting
the mayor.</p>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>Edwin Lindo remained skeptical that the Public Advocate could adequately
protect communities of color from police violence. “Great, OCC is independent,
but do you know that their findings are non-binding and SFPD does not have to
implement the recommended personnel actions from OCC? Not sure the Public
Advocate is any different.”</p>

				
				

				
						<div class="news-article-ad-container-mobile">
								
		<a href="mailto:sonja.trauss@gmail.com?subject=I'm interested in ad space!">
			<img src="../../static/square_ad.png" class="news-article-ad">
		</a>

						</div>
						
						
				
    
  
    
				<p>Other critics also suggested off-the-record that Public Advocate oversight of
the OCC would be more open to corruption than Cohen’s proposal, as it would
circumvent the checks and balances of the mayor, Board of Supervisors, and
their appointed police commission. At the meeting, Supervisor Mark Farrell,
who co-sponsored Cohen’s measure, expressed consternation that the widely
popular proposal would be combined with the Public Advocate measure “which we
know will be controversial.”</p>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>Supervisor Scott Wiener addressed what he called a “very large elephant
sitting in the room” in refusing to support Avalos’ motion: “there appears to
be a majority clique on this board, and if you are part of that clique, your
ballot measures move forward. If you’re not part of that clique, your ballot
measures get killed, even if it previously had majority support, or your
ballot measure gets merged into someone else’s ballot measure…This has been
brewing for a while.” He observed that the situation would have been
“unthinkable” just a few days prior, when Cohen’s measure had overwhelming
support.</p>

<div class="text-block">
	
	

  
    
  
    
				<p>Farrell chimed in on the dissent: “It’s the same thing as if my children come
to me saying ‘we will not do our homework unless you give us ice cream.’ In
their minds it might be related, but to any objective person watching that
scenario unfold they are completely unrelated and it’s an attempt at
extortion. It’s subverting the democratic process here at the Board of
Supervisors, and I think it’s disgusting.”</p>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>Avalos retorted, “nobody in this room has a monopoly on self-righteous
indignation.”</p>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>At one point, the clerk had to remind Supervisors that they were not allowed
to insult each other. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, once accused of <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/President-of-S-F
-supes-accused-of-harassing-3296246.php">making
threatening phone calls</a> to port staff during his previous
stint on the Board, urged his colleagues at length to return to civility.</p>

						</div>
						
						
				
    
  
    
				<p>Supervisor Cohen accused the “progressive” faction of playing party politics
with a critical nonpartisan reform issue. In a press release published later
the same day, she wrote: “Instead of allowing voters to make a decision about
whether the police department should be audited, and increase the independence
of the department which oversees officer involved shootings and allegations of
police misconduct, [Supervisors Peskin, Kim, Yee, Avalos, Campos, and Mar]
chose to politicize the issue…These two measures are completely separate and
unrelated policies…Unlike my colleagues, I do not believe we should politicize
the lives of black and brown people.”</p>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>Cohen also cited the support her measure had received from activist groups
beforehand: “Today’s vote goes directly against the very demands and cries we
have heard from our law enforcement reform advocates, including</p>
<h1>BlackLivesMatter, the Justice for Mario Woods, Justice 4 Amilcar Perez-Lopez,</h1>

				
				

				
    
  
    
				<p>Justice 4 Alex Nieto, the Center for Policing Equity, the Criminal Justice
Task Force, the Blue Ribbon Panel and ACLU. Today was a sad day for San
Francisco.”</p>

				<p>Other ballot measures decided along quasi-party lines included a proposal by
Norman Yee to give the Board more direct authority over the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority’s budget, rejecting “moderate” Scott Wiener’s ballot
measure to fund maintenance for urban trees, and approving John Avalos’
measure limiting the mayor’s ability to appoint vacancies on the Board.</p>
