  <p>Renters have been unhappy for quite some time in the Bay Area, and for good
reason. Home to the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/gallery/real_estate/2016/04/01/cities-with-
highest-rents/">highest
rents</a> in the country, the situation often seems dire, and likely to
only get worse. Some outlets have <a href="http://sf.curbed.com/2016/8/2/12356600/rents-drop-san-francisco-
san-jose-oakland-zumper">begun
reporting</a> that there may be signs of a silver lining.</p>
<p>Two separate real estate data aggregates have claimed that San Francisco’s
average rents have decreased ever-so-slightly this year. Zumper
<a href="https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data">added</a> to ApartmentList’s good
news by showing some rental decreases in Oakland and San Jose as well.</p>
<p>Far from being cause for unbridled celebration, there are many caveats to the
newly published data. While Zumper’s Oakland analysis found a 2.6% and 1.8%
monthly decrease in median one and two bedroom rent prices, respectively, the
yearly averages still rose by 11.6% and 13.8%. In San Francisco, median rent
for one-bedroom apartments fell by 1.4%, but two-bedroom prices appeared to
plateau with a mere 0.4% increase.</p>
<p>San Jose prices fell more consistently in Zumper’s data, with one-bedroom
median rents decreasing by 2.6%. Boston’s rental market has now overtaken both
San Jose and Oakland as the nation’s most expensive, trailing only New York
and San Francisco.</p>
<p>ApartmentList drew slightly different conclusions. According to their data,
San Francisco median rents dropped below those in New York both in
<a href="http://sf.curbed.com/2016/7/5/12101256/san-francisco-rents-less-new-
york">July</a> and <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/national-rent-
data/">August</a>. Zumper’s study, which weighs their listings against data from ther
U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, disputes this claim.</p>
