Oakland developer Holliday Development and the non-profit BRIDGE Housing have partnered in a plan for two apartment buildings near the El Cerrito Del Norte BART station adjoined by a pathway: a five-story 234-unit market-rate building, and a 4-story, 68-unit building of price-indexed Below Market Rentals.

Uber paid $123.5 million for the property, which they plan to use for expanded headquarters—approximately half the square footage ...
