						The project at 1515 South Van Ness (pictured above) struck a deal with the city to provide 25% Below Market Rate units. Some supporters called it unprecedented, while others insist it should be the new citywide standard. Under Proposition C), that may now be the case, but new evidence suggests that may not be a good idea. Supervisors Jane Kim and Aaron Peskin were adamant last year that their ballot measure set an economically sound baseline for affordable housing requirements in the ...

Jill Tucker of the San Francisco Chronicle reports that San Francisco faces a shortage of 38 teachers at the opening of this school year. Although retirements and resignations have dropped overall since 2015, sudden departures in the last few weeks have forced the city’s school system to scramble to fill staff openings.
