						In a scathing open letter to the Palo Alto City Council and mayor, Planning and Transportation Commissioner and renter Kate Vershov Downing announced that her family would be relocating to Santa Cruz due to the high cost of housing. She and her husband rent a home with another couple that is valued at $2.7 million. Divided into mortgage payments higher than $12,000 per month, the cost would make it impossible for the attorney and software engineer to raise a family. And so, they will leave. ...

Amid a surging economy and rapid regional population growth, San Francisco has taken varied approaches to improving the mobility of its citizens, both physically and economically. The city is not alone in its struggle. Earlier this week, liberal darling economist Paul Krugman penned a New York Times op-ed entitled “Time To Borrow,” a clarion call for government deficit spending ...

						Vulnerable rent-controlled tenants in San Jose have received a glimmer of hope as lawmakers ended an exemption for rent increases based on loan interests. Up until now, it was legal for a landlord in San Jose to raise rent beyond the allowed cap in order to pass on the costs of interest payments onto the tenant. Critics and tenant advocates argued that this arbitrarily removed any incentive for a property owner to seek good interest rates on credit, since any risk would be offset to renters ...
