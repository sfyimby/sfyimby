						On warm summer days in the Bay Area, one can often hear an onlooker remark, while gazing at the shimmering clear sky, “this is what we pay exorbitant rents for—this perfect weather.” In 2088, another major industry may be making the same overtures toward San Francisco: the Olympics. UK medical journal The Lancet’s recently published paper, “The last Summer Olympics? Climate change, health, and work outdoors” seeks to evaluate which major cities around the globe could withstand global warming ...

						Housing for teachers has been a central issue since the onset of the Bay Area’s latest affordability crisis. Jill Tucker of the San Francisco Chronicle reports that San Francisco faces a shortage of 38 teachers at the opening of this school year. Although retirements and resignations have dropped overall since 2015, sudden departures in the last few weeks have forced the city’s school system to scramble to fill staff openings. Despite the dire situation, Superintendent Richard Carranza spoke ...

After District 9 Director Tom Radulovich announced two weeks ago that he would not be running for reelection, the BART Board race became a free-for-all among non-incumbents. Lisa Feldstein’s recently announced departure from the race leaves two candidates: former Supervisor Bevan Dufty, and local activist Michael Petrelis.

Under the city charter, Whittum’s unexpected resignation forces the city to create a special election independent of statewide or municipal elections because his vacancy was declared more than 180 days before the November election. Whittum would have had to retire later than April 12 for the elections to be consolidated. Sunnyvale’s City Council lamented the ...
