  <h2>Mayor Lee Vetoes Resolution, Supports Governor&#39;s Bill</h2>
  <h4>text-block</h4>
<p>text:</p>
<p>San Francisco's Mayor Edwin Lee announced today that he would be vetoing the
Board of Supervisors’ resolution to amend or oppose a trailer bill proposed by
Governor Jerry Brown to streamline housing production. We reported earlier on
the two competing resolutions recommending amendments to the Governor’s “by-
right” trailer bill. Supervisor Scott Wiener’s resolution failed to pass,
while Supervisor Aaron Peskin’s resolution did. Peskin’s resolution called for
categorically opposing Brown’s reforms unless a discretionary review process
with public input was maintained.</p>
<p>It was precisely this condition on which Mayor Lee based his veto. In his
letter to the Board, he noted that the permitting process for construction in
coastal California cities takes 30% longer than in any other state, and
expressed optimism that Governor Brown’s legislation could be one of many
tools to ameliorate the region’s housing affordability crisis. Last month, the
Mayor had also communicated his support to the Governor, with suggested
amendments.</p>
