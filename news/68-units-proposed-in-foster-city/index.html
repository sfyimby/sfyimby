    <p>In San Mateo County, a planned city on a former landfill south of San
Francisco may see 68 new homes in the midst of an office construction boom.
Development firm Sares Regis Group of Northern California, LLC submitted an
application to build 68 townhouses at the corner of East Hillsdale Boulevard
and Triton Drive. 14 homes would be reserved at Below Market Rate rents for
households earning 80-120% of Area Median Income, while the remaining 54 would
be rented at market rate.</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>The project seeks to fulfill a ten year-old Master Plan for the area in a
portion known as Phase C, with a zoning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_\(land_use\">variance</a>) for more than
the allowed 17 residential units, and is intended to provide housing close to
transit and jobs as employment in San Mateo County continues to grow. The
townhomes would include a shuttle service to the nearby CalTrain station, and
is located a half-mile from offices of major employers including Visa, IBM,
and Gilead.</p>

<div class="text-block">
  
    
  
    
    <p>This comes in the wake of
<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/09/02/gilead-snags-
foster-city-land-where-it-could-build.html">major</a> commercial real estate purchases
by Gilead Sciences, a $19 billion pharmaceutical company with nearly 8,000
employees that primarily focuses on antiviral medication. Gilead paid $120
million for two adjacent sites at Foster City Boulevard totaling 12 acres.
Zoned for 800,000 square feet of office space, the site would be an expansion
of the pharma giant’s nearby campus, and would add thousands of jobs to the
housing-scarce region.</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>Sares Regis’ new project is similar to a previous proposal in <a href="../../news/68-units-proposed-in-foster-city/ht
tp:/citydocs.fostercity.org/sirepub/cache/2/onefboxou2usw3onfnyldxzk/25460307
262016023156608.PDF">May of 2015</a> for 65-70 townhomes that was stonewalled by neighborhood
opposition. City Council elicited feedback from the community in considering a
zoning variance for the site, and the resulting backlash forced Sares Regis to
wait for the next election cycle before restarting the entitlement process.
The developer is optimistic that building new housing close to office space
will reduce demand for cars and ease traffic congestion.</p>

<div class="text-block">
  
    
  
    
    <p>Despite these assurances, the local community’s <a href="http://citydocs.fo
stercity.org/sirepub/cache/2/onefboxou2usw3onfnyldxzk/97963207262016023025311.
PDF">concerns </a>mostly focused on traffic congestion, as well as the potential strain on
public schools. One resident wrote to City Council: “Perhaps I am selfish — I
love our city and do not want it to become an overcrowded area like Redwood
City…I do NOT want any more schools — build UP I say.”</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>“Have you tried to enter Foster City during the evening commute hours?” one
resident demanded of the council. “Frustrating, exhausting, both mentally and
from the gas fumes.”</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>Conversely, other residents complained that Foster City was already an
undesirable place to live in due to its rental housing density: “Foster City
is already a city with too many low income housing, too many rentals, [so]
please stop making Foster City the capital of low income housing in [the] mid-
Peninsula,” one resident pleaded. Another wrote, more bluntly: “As is well
known, Foster City is already overcrowded so no more housing.”</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>Sares Regis will be returning to Foster City Council for a preliminary review
on August 1.</p>
