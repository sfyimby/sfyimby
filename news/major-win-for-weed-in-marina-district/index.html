    <p>Medical cannabis is coming to northern San Francisco. On June 22nd, the Board
of Appeals denied an appeal brought forth by the Cow Hollow Association
intended to deny a permit application by The Apothecarium to open a new
dispensary location at 2414 Lombard Street. The applicants retained their
approval despite strong lobbying by organized neighbors, Supervisor Mark
Farrell, and Mayor Ed Lee.</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>Representatives from the Cow Hollow Association, a neighborhood group of
approximately 350 member households, insisted that their opposition focused
only on the specific location. Opponents asserted that locating a medical
cannabis dispensary (MCD) within 1000 feet from the Edward II group home for
at-risk young adults, and a martial arts studio serving mostly young students,
posed a public safety risk. “We have no issue with that,” a CHA representative
stated, referring both to the benefits of medical marijuana, and The
Apothecarium’s positive business reputation.</p>

      </div>
    
    
  
    
    <p>These claims are contradicted by the numerous letters the Board of Appeals
received <a href="http://sfgov.org/bdappeal/sites/default/files
/Item%208%2C%20Appeal%20No.%2016-056%20%40%202412%20Lombard%20Street%20Part%20
3%20-%20Public%20Comment%20Supporting%20the%20Appeal_3_1.pdf">supporting the appeal</a>, citing concerns
that children would be enticed into a life of drug addiction and that
criminals would begin roaming the area. “I strongly prefer that my children
not be exposed on a daily basis to the constant drug use occurring at an MCD,”
wrote one local resident. (Consumption of cannabis products is not allowed in
almost any MCD in the country, and The Apothecarium employs security staff to
enforce this rule.) “The character of the City is changing, and we need
families to continue representing well-rounded values. Doctor’s offices and
hospitals are the places where medicine should be dispensed and
administered—not the middle of busy Lombard Street surrounded by cheap motels
and homeless youth treatment centers.”</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>Another opponent wrote that children in the area are “already exposed to a
seedy element along Lombard. We should all be working to make that better, not
worse.” Other opponents cited concerns over the location’s proximity to a
massage parlor they allege is a front for prostitution. In one of the rare
letters that did not follow a form template, one parent wrote: “The kids
already learn and see a lot…so I don’t think we need additional exposure to
the ups and downs of city life.”</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>In contrast, a citizen writing <a href="http://sfgov.org/bdappeal/sites/de
fault/files/Item%208%2C%20Appeal%20No.%2016-056%20%40%202412%20Lombard%20Stree
t%20Part%204%20-%20Public%20Comment%20Opposing%20the%20Appeal_2_1.pdf">in support</a> of The
Apothecarium described them as “a quiet, considerate neighbor” near his
residence in the Castro District. This supporter was one of many who cited
increased foot traffic, safety, and clean sidewalks.</p>

    <p>Speaking in person at the Board of Appeals, Supervisor Mark Farrell noted that
he had told the applicants years ago that he did not consider 2414 Lombard a
good location for a dispensary. “If they could bring a project somewhere that
would not engender neighborhood opposition,” he said, “I would fully support
it.”</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.hansonbridgett.com/Our-Attorneys/m-brett-
gladstone.aspx">Brett Gladstone</a>, the land-use attorney representing The Apothecarium, says
there’s more to the story. In a lengthy phone interview, he described how
neighbors initially opposed the 25 units of supportive housing at 3155 Scott
Street, known as the Edward II, operated by Larkin Street Youth Services.
After the Planning Commission sided in favor of Larkin Street, the Cow Hollow
Association threatened to appeal to the Board of Supervisors, while also
lobbying Congress to withhold federal funding for the project. If all else
failed, a lawsuit was strongly implied.</p>

    
      <div class="news-article-ad-container">
        <img src="../../static/fake_ad_1.png" class="news-article-ad">
        <!--<img src="../../static/fake_ad_2.png" class="news-article-ad">
        <img src="../../static/fake_ad_3.png" class="news-article-ad">-->
      </div>
    
    
  
    
    <p>In response to these threats, Larkin Street Youth Center entered into a
“neighborhood benefits agreement” with Cow Hollow, stipulating monthly
meetings and ground rules, including “no hanging out on the sidewalk,” says
Gladstone. “In addition,” he said, “Cow Hollow [has] access on short notice to
inspect the site and make sure Larkin Street is meeting its agreements.”
Edward II also agreed to support neighborhood groups over public safety
concerns, which Gladstone suspects contributed to the opposition. The 25 units
for housing-insecure youth, ages ranging from 18-25, opened in late 2014.</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>The argument ultimately hinges on shifting cultural attitudes toward
marijuana: some still see it as a dangerous criminal activity, while others
insist patients only stand to benefit from its medicinal consumption. Skeptics
of Larkin Street’s opposition objected to the portrayal of Edward II tenants
as prone to criminality, given that it is not a residence for ex-convicts or
recovering alcoholics.</p>

<div class="text-block">
  
    
  
    
    <p>In his client’s opinion, Gladstone says, the implicit threat of litigation and
“fearmongering” about lapsing into addiction was enough for Larkin Street
Youth Services to be concerned. What they found most curious is that this
alliance urged Larkin Street to overlook the fact that some of the residents
in Edward II are already legal medical cannabis patients. “Larkin Street
tenants are adults,” Gladstone noted, “and if they have a medical condition
that can be addressed by medical marijuana, they have the right. It was made
clear by Larkin Street that their rules for the building don’t prohibit use of
marijuana: they can’t. It’s a medication.” He also noted that medical
marijuana may already be available within Edward II habitations: “When they’re
over 18, they’re allowed to grow several marijuana plants if they have a
medical card.”</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>Supporters of The Apothecarium were surprised when Commissioner Ann Lazarus
said on the record at the Board of Appeals meeting that the mayor had called
her and told her to vote against The Apothecarium. “We were quite pleased that
we could overcome what permit applicants can rarely overcome,” Gladstone told
us: “lobbying from the mayor of the city and organized neighbors.”</p>

    <p>Within a six-block radius of 2414 Lombard Street, there are four liquor
stores, a wine merchant, and ten bars.</p>

    
    
  
    
    <p>At press time, neither Supervisor Farrell nor Larkin Street Youth Services had
responded to requests for comment.</p>
