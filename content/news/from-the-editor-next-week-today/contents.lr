As the despondency and disgust for the burning dumpster fire that is 2016 gives way to dread and ambivalence toward the unknown horrors of 2017, we wish to alert our readers to an abundance of political and cultural happenings taking place in the Greater Bay Area Metropolis as of next week. This may also serve as a subtle preview for next week’s content.

* Monday, January 2nd: **The Ivy Room** in Albany hosts [a tribute](https://www.facebook.com/events/1074708429321927/) to Berkeley’s iconic punk imprint Lookout! Records as part of a week-long *Lookouting* retrospective. The concert will feature resurrected punk bands from days of yore—the spastic, slapstick Surrogate Brains from Stockton, and Santa Rosa booze-laden garage-punks The Invalids—along with Dr. Frank, the polymath auteur behind classic pop-punk outfit [The Mr. T Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xn9ZhmY_10). $10 / 21+ / 8pm

* Tuesday, January 3rd: The **San Francisco Municipal Transit Agency** (SFMTA) Board of Directors meeting will be held at 1:00pm in City Hall, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place, Room 400. The Board is widely expected to approve the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the Geary Bus Rapid Transit project, which would dedicate a lane on either side of Geary Boulevard to Muni buses. With an initial feasibility report completed in 2007, Geary BRT is nearly a decade in the making, but evidently, some still feel that change has come too soon. [Despite local pressure](http://www.sfexaminer.com/transit-officials-offer-tweaks-to-geary-brt-project/) for the Board to delay approval to make time for more “community input,” former Richmond District Supervisor Eric Mar argued that “endless delays” were no longer necessary. 

* Wednesday, January 4th: **Oakland Councilmember-at-large Rebecca Kaplan** will host [a forum with the Oakland Warehouse Coalition](https://www.facebook.com/events/1543924842289311/) in Council  Chambers, Oakland City Hall,  at 5pm to discuss the city’s responses to the Ghost Ship warehouse fire. Kaplan’s office has announced: “The forum will address housing, homelessness, and jobs, and will be focused on solutions. We’d love for you to come and bring folks.”

* Thursday, January 5th: San Francisco’s **Planning Commission** will review the [Draft Environmental Impact Report](http://commissions.sfplanning.org/cpcpackets/2009.0159E_Draft%20EIR.pdf) (EIR) for the One Oak Street Project, a 40-story 310-unit residential tower proposed at 1500-1540 Market Street. The project seeks to add a public plaza on Oak Street, to be serviced by new elevators to the Van Ness Muni station below. [The Mark Company](http://www.themarkcompany.com/project/one-oak/), the developer behind One Oak, will need to extend the Height and Bulk District 120/400-R-2 designation across the block for the design to be zoning-compliant.

* Friday, January 6th: Oakland techno showcase **Obscura Machina** will go on as planned, despite the passing of its gregarious organizer, [Micah Danemayer](http://sfbamo.com/news/in-memoriam-micah-danemayer/), in the tragic Ghost Ship fire. Danemayer’s collaborator Devyn Saturnus will debut their new project Red Cellar as part of his plans to carry on the torch for his fallen friend’s imprint, Discarded Records. Red Cellar will be joined by the dark, minimal electro-croonings of [Stacian](https://stacian.bandcamp.com/album/songs-for-cadets), the industrial duo [Plattenbau](https://soundcloud.com/glowingdaggerrecords/sets/plattenbau-body-of-desire), lo-fi ambient producer [Fascination](https://discardedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/fascination-scenarios-of-violence-009-2), and Los Angeles-based [DJ Sailor Saturn](https://soundcloud.com/djsailorsaturn/). The event will be held at The Night Light, 311 Broadway, Oakland. All proceeds will fund the Micah Danemayer Memorial Scholarship at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. $7 / 21+ / 9pm.
