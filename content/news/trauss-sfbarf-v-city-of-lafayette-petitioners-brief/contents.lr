Last year, our webmaster Sonja Trauss filed a [lawsuit](http://www.carlaef.org/s/FINAL-Second-Amended-Petition-with-exhibits.pdf) against the City of Lafayette, a wealthy East Bay suburb, for violating state housing law. The suit concerns Homes at Deer Hill, a development of 44 single-family homes estimated to sell for $1.2 million. The developer, O'Brien Homes, had previously proposed a 315-unit apartment complex at the same site, but was met with stiff local opposition. [This article](http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/city-housing-activists-test-out-brazen-new-battle-cry-sue-the-suburbs) from *San Francisco Magazine* provides ample background, and the recently filed [petitioners' brief](http://www.carlaef.org/s/Petitioners-Memorandum-of-Points-and-Authorities-in-Support-of-Petition-for-Writ-of-Administrative-M.pdf) is below.
