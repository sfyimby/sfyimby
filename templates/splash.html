        In 2014, Kim-Mai Cutler published her groundbreaking article,
        <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/"
          target="_blank">How Burrowing Owls Lead To Vomiting Anarchists (Or
        SFâ€™s Housing Crisis Explained)</a>.

          target="_blank">San Francisco Housing Action Coalition (SFHAC)</a>
      honored Cutler at their Housing Heroes Awards for inspiring legions of
      grassroots activists.
