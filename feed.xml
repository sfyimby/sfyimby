				&lt;p&gt;Two new articles discuss interacting milestones in the global economy and local housing market, and how the fundamental problem of supply still remains.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;First, the bad news: on Thursday, the SF &lt;em&gt;Business Times&lt;/em&gt; published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2016/10/guest-opinion-sf-housing-future-nimby-rental.html?utm_content=buffere66a1&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer&quot;&gt;guest editorial&lt;/a&gt; by affordable housing developer John Stewart, discussing how the recent bump in unit production fails to put a meaningful dent in San Francisco's affordability problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;...As the Business Times reported last week, that’s resulted in a historic burst of housing, with an estimated 5,000 units to be completed this year. Unfortunately, this slope reversed direction just as quickly: Concord’s estimate of permit issuances for this year is approximately 3,000, meaning San Francisco will return to its low level of housing production.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In round numbers, the city of San Francisco has approximately 365,000 dwelling units of which two-thirds, or about 250,000 units are rental. Producing 3,000 unis a year (and San Francisco normally does even less) represents a modest 1.2 percent annual increase in rental inventory. When attrition and Ellis Act conversions are taken into account, we are barely better than replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;He then points to the slim pickings left in the pipeline: these include large-scale, long-timeline projects such as Treasure Island, Park Merced, Pier 70 and Schlage Lock, well away from the City center, and which continue to face considerable political and financial difficulties, all for “a little over 24,000 units.” It also includes another not quite 17,000 units in the neighborhoods, which while lower profile, also have lower percentages of affordable housing, and are more exposed to the City’s death-of-a-thousand-cuts discretionary permitting.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Stewart’s prognosis, particularly for renters, isn’t good: any drop in rents will come from lower demand, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in San Francisco Magazine,  Kim-Mai Cutler has only &lt;a href=&quot;http://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-great-cooling&quot;&gt;slightly better news&lt;/a&gt; for prospective home buyers, mainly as a consequence of uncertainty over the throttling of economic growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a dramatic slowdown. After all, employment levels are near all-time highs, as are rents and median housing prices. And inventory is still distressingly low: There are currently only about 400 single-family homes and 540 condos for sale in San Francisco, and both categories of housing spend an average of 49 days on the Bay Area market, according to Zillow—the lowest in the nation. But there’s an air of uncertainty over job production in the tech sector, which has for the past several years fueled much of the outlandish growth in housing prices in the Bay Area. “We’re thinking there will be a correction in the next couple of years, but we think it starts with the high end turning, and then it spreads [to slowing] job creation,” says UC Berkeley economist Kenneth Rosen, who has been studying Bay Area real estate markets for 37 years. “The key to the Bay Area depends on capital markets. The question is, will unicorns succeed and go public or have to cut back?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Cutler then outlines how ownership demand hasn’t declined so much as diffused - rippling out to the East Bay, driven in some measure by the increasing use of company shuttles by employers. The suburbs are no longer cheap. Barring economic catastrophe, lack of supply, along with little growth in salaries, means the affordability issues afflicting the Bay Area will still be with us.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The prime takeaway from these two articles is that the struggle to reform policy and community thinking about housing supply is far from over. Talk of San Francisco’s “historic burst” of housing production in 2013 ultimately remains a distraction from the fundamental supply and structural policy issues which define the region’s affordability crisis. Nobody is off the hook on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <name>Laura Fingal-Surma</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laura Fingal-Surma serves on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://progressnoe.com&quot;&gt;Progress Noe Valley&lt;/a&gt; Advisory Board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Dear San Francisco Planning Department staff, President Fong, and Commissioners,&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We advocate on behalf of more than 200 neighbors who believe that Noe Valley’s brightest days are still ahead of us. We want more of what urban life has to offer and not less. The current housing affordability crisis moved us beyond frustration into action. As part of the growing Yes In My Back Yard movement, we believe that our neighborhood should be part of the solution and not the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The current Tantamount to Demolition policy is too open to interpretation and doesn’t work well for anyone, including those seeking residential expansions. Unclear policies create financial incentive for less scrupulous behavior and reward the wrong people. We applaud your &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf-planning.org/residential-expansion-threshold&quot;&gt;effort&lt;/a&gt; to tackle the complex problem of replacing the current policy with something better.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;That being said, any new process of reviewing residential expansion projects in neighborhoods like ours is a major opportunity for those who resist growth and change to create a new tool that locks out newcomers, artificially inflates property values, drives gentrification of lower income neighborhoods, and pushes new housing production to environmentally irresponsible locations. Other methods of obstruction are proving unsuccessful in the midst of the unprecedented housing crisis, so opponents of growth are shifting their focus to strict interpretations of scale and neighborhood compatibility. It is very concerning to see this NIMBY preoccupation with “scale” creeping in as the focus of an otherwise sensible reworking of flawed policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The evidence is clear. Even the Obama administration has weighed in, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/Housing_Development_Toolkit%20f.2.pdf&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; that overly restrictive land use policy is driving income inequality and dragging down the national economy. We are counting on you to prevent the new policy replacing Tantamount to Demolition from becoming just another tool of obstructionism. The Residential Expansion Threshold should be data-driven and rigorously tested against real-world data from past projects. While we trust that there are certainly completed projects that could have benefited from more sophisticated design review, we already have the Residential Design Guidelines to guide scale. If appropriate scale really must be reconsidered, evidence should first be compiled to demonstrate the flaws in the current policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Although intellectually interesting, it is pointless to define and debate the appropriate threshold to trigger a Planning Commission hearing in the abstract. In order to define the solution, we must first clearly define the problem. We encourage the Planning Department and Commission to identify numerous examples of past projects that would have ideally been modified had they been affected by the new process — and generate the policy from there. The policy should then be tested against a substantial set of additional past projects and revised until it achieves the desired outcomes before being implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We offer our more detailed input as bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;strong&gt;IDEAS WE SUPPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;If not floor area ratio, square footage may very well be the best way to define the threshold as it is one of the most straightforward methods for objectively quantifying a building. However, even such a simple measurement is not entirely straightforward and can be manipulated. There should be clearly defined standards for how square footage is measured for this purpose, the calculations should be easily replicable, and Planning staff should spot check for compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many of the more ambitious residential projects that we need to grow and maintain our housing stock will inevitably face Discretionary Review. Approval timelines for such projects are already exceptionally long in San Francisco. Every opportunity should be explored to prevent the proposed new hearing from adding months to approvals for these projects — through parallelization, qualifying a significant percentage of affected projects for the consent calendar, and new monthly meeting dates dedicated to this type of hearing with not just theoretical but real limits on turnaround time. Time added to a project is also cost added, and hence housing cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AREAS OF CONCERN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The current proposal amounts to a doubling down on RH-1 zoning at exactly the time we should be questioning whether such zoning belongs in the city in the first place. Reducing allowable massing in RH-1 areas all but ensures that they will never evolve into RH-2 and RH-3 areas, with the “out of scale” massing requirements of multiunit buildings cited as the excuse. RH-1 zoning is so widespread that this significantly reduces the potential capacity of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Earlier proposals incentivized maximization of principally permitted density — without penalizing multiunit projects constrained by outdated density controls that prevent them from taking full advantage of their buildable area before exceeding the threshold. An easy win-win solution would be for such a situation to trigger a relaxation of density controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Is the intention of any expansion threshold, such as 3000 ground square feet per unit, to incentivize production of new dwelling units — or to effectively ban units larger than the threshold? If not a de facto ban, the merits of which would be dubious, does the Planning Commission belong in the business of judging who is deserving of a larger unit? How could a fair process possibly be established to determine who is deserving? Regardless of the threshold, there will be many existing units larger than it, and there will be no test for purchasing one of those. If a reduction in allowable scale can be made objective enough to be fair, surely it can be performed administratively with Planning Commission oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In addition to the many concerns about introducing even more barriers to city living for families (that were well-represented at the September 22 hearing), a de facto ban on new larger units could amount to a handout to the wealthy owners of existing larger homes and units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We see aesthetic preferences for small scale living within the city as a much greater driver of housing scarcity than the occasional oversized unit occupying space that might have accommodated more households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We strongly question the idea of neighborhood-specific thresholds that reinforce existing patterns of economic segregation and imply that, holding lot size constant, some neighborhoods are less responsible for accommodating growth than others. The scale of building expansions allowable under the Residential Design Guidelines is already context-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We are especially skeptical of any neighborhood-specific threshold determined by an average of the square footages of existing buildings. Records are simply not reliable, and they err significantly low:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is little reason to believe that the available square footage records were measured consistently in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;San Francisco is full of older residential buildings that have been modified and expanded without permits. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when older buildings were expanded with permits, records do not always accurately reflect increased floor area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if square footage records could be trusted, they are not in terms of gross square feet like the currently proposed threshold. An older unmodified single family home often features an entire floor plate of valuable garage and/or storage space that would not show up in any records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Excluding historic district status, what entitles an underutilized neighborhood to stay that way indefinitely? Every individual parcel derives significant value from collective investment that should not be squandered. If a citywide threshold is not appropriate, a threshold based upon lot size would be equitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;If the goal is truly to generate more units per parcel and not to appease NIMBYs, carrots are better than sticks. Have the available carrots been thoroughly explored? For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can approvals be expedited for projects that achieve this objective rather than slowed for others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least in our neighborhood, there are clearly market forces driving production of large single family homes on RH-2 lots that could have otherwise become two units. Would that be happening if more (smaller) units were possible within the same massing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historically, existing larger homes were commonly subdivided during hard economic times to drive costs down. How can we enable this again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is widely recognized that small units are more affordable by design. While we understand the concerns raised about “sham units,” we are even more concerned about discouraging production of new units through a top-down approach to the distribution of space between them. Each family and building is unique, and the sizes and configurations of units affected by the new policy should not be overly prescriptive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping a fixed amount of housing smaller and older is not an effective method for making housing more affordable, especially in the long term. Building more housing is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In reviewing the information available about the Residential Expansion Threshold, we see and hear a strong theme of moving toward a planning process that is more predictable, accountable, and easier to explain. We have confidence in you as professionals and leaders and are optimistic that this will remain a driving principle as the new policy takes shape.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;As I walked to my office from the Civic Center BART station, I took a detour to find the source of marching band music I heard off in the distance. Sure enough, a drumline was marching in front of a massive regimented marching band, flooding most of the pavement in front of City Hall with a sea of yellow uniforms and blaring horn music.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At the first intersection, I spotted young woman in semi-traditional Chinese garb waving robotically atop a parade float. Before I could ask someone what holiday it was, someone handed me a flier—in thick bold letters, it read: &lt;em&gt;Help Stop Forced Live Organ Harvesting from Falun Gong and Other Prisoners of Conscience in China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Practitioners of Falun Gong (a.k.a. Falun Dafa), a Chinese meditation discipline, have faced violent reprisals from the Chinese communist party since the late 1990s. The parade, one of several this month, sought to draw attention to recent allegations that Falun Gong imprisonment had been used as a source of living organ donors freely exploited by the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This demonstration served as a bookend of sorts, after a weekend of parades and a Falun Gong &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2176742-falun-gong-experience-sharing-conference-held-in-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; held yesterday at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over 200,000 People Have Filed Lawsuits Against Former Chinese Dictator Jiang Zemin&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Across the street, on the steps in front of the California Superior Court, an entirely different demonstration had formed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The US PROStitutes Collective (US PROS), partnering with the Erotic Service Providers Union, the Transgender Law Center, and a member of Amnesty International, staged a protest against the arrest of Backpage.com CEO Carl Ferrer. Ferrer, founder of the paid classified service that allows sex workers to advertise their services, was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/07/497006100/ceo-of-backpage-com-arrested-charged-with-pimping&quot;&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; in Houston on pimping charges after three years of undercover investigations by the California Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Much of the crowd’s ire was directed at California’s Attorney General Kamala Harris, who many expect to win the race for U.S. Senator. “You’re ahead in the polls,” one protestor said through a megaphone, “you don’t need to persecute us with this publicity stunt for political gain.” Many signs and chants pointed to a lack of services and safety for sex workers, which criminalization would only further exacerbate.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/at-civic-center-plaza-persecuted-groups-speak-out/protest5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I Can Not Believe I Have To Protest This Shit&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I can’t believe I have to protest this shit!” a protester chanted.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It’s digital segregation,” another demonstrator said. “When will we be allowed to join the modern age?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;One demonstrator who declined to identify themselves insisted that online advertising was essential for sex workers to feel safe in conducting business.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It will kill free speech to pursue this as a criminal case,” the demonstrator continued, asserting that the alleged victims in the Backpage.com trafficking case could have more easily sought a settlement for damages in civil court.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The demonstrator reinforced the crowd’s general sentiment that the prosecution efforts were all for show, and were unlikely to succeed. “He’s got really solid case law supporting him,” she said of Ferrer. “Beyond that, what they really want is to displace us from our work, making it harder to advertise. Back in the days of Craigslist is free—so the whole idea that they’re making money off of it, that’s because we can no longer advertise for free. You take away that, and our safety is on a slippery slope.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The original arrest warrant &lt;a href=&quot;https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/signed%20dec%20for%20arrest%20warrant%20pdf_Redacted.pdf?&quot;&gt;confirms&lt;/a&gt; that Backpage classifieds emerged directly after the closure of Cragislist’s “Adult” section. Ferrer has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/File%20endorsed%20Criminal%20Complaint%20tjy_Redacted.pdf?&quot;&gt;charged&lt;/a&gt; with a total of ten separate counts of pimping.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Members of the Erotic Service Providers Union also discussed an ongoing lawsuit against the Attorney General’s office seeking to overturn California’s anti-prostitution law by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://esplerp.org&quot;&gt;Erotic Service Providers Legal Education Research Project (ESPLERP)&lt;/a&gt;. In a motion to dismiss the suit, Harris &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/01/22/marriage-ruling-cited-in-brief-to-overturn-prostitution-law/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that “[t]here is no fundamental right to engage in prostitution or to solicit prostitution,” a statement that has inflamed the sex worker rights community. Harris has previously &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laweekly.com/news/a-new-movement-to-legalize-prostitution-faces-a-fight-with-kamala-harris-5570911&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that sex work “compromises the quality of life in a community.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Several members of ESPLERP noted a particular irony in the Attorney General’s perceived crusade against sex workers. These demonstrators alleged that Harris had dubbed herself an “honorary prostitute” in an attempt to “pander” to sex worker advocates at the Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club in 2007, when she was running for reelection as the San Francisco District Attorney.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“If Kamala Harris really cared about protecting women, she would investigate Bay Area police departments, which have a long history of systematically exploiting and extorting sex workers,&quot; ESPLERP's Claire Alwyne said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://esplerp.org/sex-workers-outraged-at-backpage-charges/&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Despite identifying myself as a member of the press, I was eventually drafted into joining the protestors. I was given a sign reading “Stop Taxpayer Funded Witch Hunts,” and there are likely many pictures and videos of me standing in the back row, looking supportive of the cause (I hope) but unsure if I belonged up there.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I stood next to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfist.com/2010/03/04/bisexual_sex_worker_starchild_runni.php&quot;&gt;Starchild&lt;/a&gt;, a local sex worker advocate and Libertarian Party member, as he chanted impromptu slogans into a megaphone. Starchild urged participants to view the arrest as a threat to internet privacy and net neutrality, not just workers' rights.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“First they come for the sex workers. Then it could be the LGBT community. Who’s next?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The crowd repeated after him: “who’s next?”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Members of the unincorporated housing advocacy group Palo Alto Forward were shocked to find filings for a Political Action Committee (PAC) under their name last week, which could set back their ongoing efforts to register as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. The PAC was registered by Timothy Gray, treasurer for the City Council campaign of Lydia Kou.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Gray claimed in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2016/10/24/palo-alto-forward-claims-impersonation-after-its-name-is-registered-as-a-pac&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Palo Alto Weekly&lt;/em&gt; that he had no knowledge of the preexisting Palo Alto Forward, and that he registered the name to prevent citizens from being “duped.” Gray claims, paradoxically, that he was not aware of Palo Alto Forward’s activities, and that he registered the PAC name after the city had registered paloaltoforward.org to conduct community outreach for its Comprehensive Plan back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sandra Slater, co-founder of Palo Alto Forward, called Gray’s claims “patently ridiculous,” given that Gray had co-signed a letter opposing the group last year. Gray registered the PAC within days of formally registering as the treasurer of Lydia Kou’s city council campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Until recently, Gray served as treasurer of Palo Altans for Sensible Zoning (PASZ), a PAC that formed opposition to a 2013 ballot measure that would have rezoned for greater residential density on Maybell Avenue, and has endorsed Kou in this election cycle. Lydia Kou’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lydiakou.com/about_me&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; boasts of the candidate’s direct involvement in defeating the referendum, known as Measure D:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Faced with an uncompromising Council, I became one of the leaders of the group that put the issue on the ballot. I knew from listening to residents that there was widespread opposition to the project, but to confirm that, I had my neighborhood association conduct a survey of its membership and subsequently authorize funding a petition drive to have a referendum on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kou told the &lt;em&gt;Weekly&lt;/em&gt; that she was unaware of Gray’s PAC registration until recently. She asserts that he told her he was “trying to ensure the city of Palo Alto is not inadvertently being misled by an organization taking a domaine [sic] that the city has used.” Gray also claimed that Palo Alto Forward had been “under investigation for violation of reporting rules”—something Slater vehemently denies. Such allegations, Slater pointed out, further undermine his claim that he had not heard of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Slater added that Gray had never contacted Palo Alto Forward to raise any concerns that the name was deceptive. Palo Alto Forward had communicated with the city before launching their own website, ensuring that Palo Alto had taken down paloaltoforward.org as legally required in 2014, after the Comprehensive Plan referendum measure was placed on the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We have never taken money from anyone, and we certainly have not spent money on electioneering or politics - just community education following the rules for 501c3 non-profits,” Palo Alto Forward said in a press release. Further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We have NEVER been “under investigation for violation of reporting rules.”
We are trying to register as 501(c)(3) and this hurts our ability to do so because they're not supposed to be involved in political efforts and PAF isn't. We don't take in any money from outside sources and we don't spend any on political campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I buy all the refreshments for our meetings,” Slater added in a phone interview. “I pick up fruit, soda, cheese, and crackers, because we know people will be hungry when they leave work and we want them to be able to focus on the issues we’re discussing. We’re entirely about community education. I host many events at my house, and some at the public library, which is all free.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Lydia Kou’s council campaign, along with that of Arthur Keller, recently made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2016/10/14/large-checks-boost-campaigns-of-kou-keller#comment_form&quot;&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; for receiving over $30,000 each in contributions from a small number of residents.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kou, a local realtor, pays property taxes on a $1 million assessed value of her home, though the average sale price in the neighborhood is $2.5 million (lower than Palo Alto’s median home price of $4 million). Public tax records show she did not claim a homeowner’s exemption on filings over the past two years. The &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; has launched an ongoing investigation to ensure that Kou’s primary residence is in fact in Palo Alto, as local election laws require.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, last Friday night at the Warfield would have been unthinkable. San Jose’s stoner-metal heroes Sleep were historic legends, their few albums revered as untouchable classics while the trio splintered into newer, heavier projects. But returns in the market for classic metal albums churn out slower than their songs, and over 20 years after disbanding, the band has found the audience that was always waiting for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Hearing the sheer force of air pressure that is their songs, it’s hard to believe the masses weren’t ready for Sleep in the early ‘90s. The trio of Al Cisneros, Matt Pike, and Chris Hakius split up in 1995 after major label London Records refused to release their “unmarketable” hour-long dirge, &lt;em&gt;Dopesmoker.&lt;/em&gt; Those record executives may have been embarrassed to see how many fans were willfully subjecting themselves to whiplash at the Warfield as they played a relatively brief, half-hour snippet of the tune.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Brandishing joints and glass pipes that filled the air with a psychedelic scent, legions chanted along with Cisneros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Drrrop out of life&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;with BONG&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;IN&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;HAAAAAAAAAND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hIw7oeZKpZc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Opening act Helen Money, an enormously talented solo cellist, hardly needed to mention the debt her sound owed to Sleep. Augmented with distortion and loop pedals, her strings filled the air with a thundering, metallic roar. 

“It’s really an honor” she said of her role in the short tour. The honor was equally ours in getting to see her take up the mantle of stoner-metal pioneer with such aplomb, with her own neoclassical twist.


&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQCO-opZKBc?list=PLN3lgHnAvXz5j8_JiJq8GQLvOrpp-tbOh&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Until recently, Sleep remained in relative obscurity, their records hungrily sought-after by the niche crowd adoring “stoner metal,” “stoner doom,” “sludge,” really all the drug-laced sub-sub-genres that trace their lineage directly back to Black Sabbath’s first three albums. (One of Sleep’s songs “Inside the Sun” is not so much an homage or blatant rip-off as it is a deliberate sequel, lyrically and musically, to Black Sabbath’s “Into the Void” from 1971.) The legend seeped into some cult films—Harmony Korrine famously used “Dragonaut” for a sequence in his experimental collage &lt;em&gt;Gummo&lt;/em&gt;, and Jim Jarmusch sampled “Dopesmoker” in &lt;em&gt;Broken Flowers.&lt;/em&gt; But their influence spread like an adaptive mutation that strengthened the musical species.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sleep’s monolithic status in the metal pantheon stretches beyond the human members, who kept on being pioneers long after the group folded. Al Cisneros and Chris Hakius formed Om, initially just a drum-bass duo distilling Sleep’s slow-blues into a yoga meditation soundtrack. Matt Pike now leads a faster, more aggressive group, High On Fire, which still regularly tours the country. In the seven years since their initial reunion, as Sleep continues to headline festivals worldwide and prepare to release new music, it’s as though they never left.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sleep added one new song to their set, and a mere three songs from their perennial classic &lt;em&gt;Holy Mountain.&lt;/em&gt; The record is a testament to their underground popularity, originally an unsolicited demo tape that was released by Earache Records virtually as soon as they received it. The titular track, drawing cheers when the audience recognized its one-chord riff, was played at roughly a third of the speed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Guitarist Matt Pike, barechested as always, oozed sheer volume that could silence a jet engine. His lightspeed-blues solos, showing equal influence from Black Sabbath and Ravi Shankar, explored some quieter, subtler terrain sometimes.  Bassist Al Cisneros sang in a higher, more meditative register typical of his band Om, where he applies Sleep’s THC-drenched technique to forms inspired by Islamic and Buddhist ritual. By the end of a crushing, monumental 90 minutes, the audience was fully entranced.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4cxaVEqZsE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While “Holy Mountain” was merely a slower, heavier interpretation of the original, “Dragonaut” took on a new life as Pike noodled through the iconic guitar lick with the drunken abandon of an early blues musician.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The line isn’t really that bad,” someone said as the crowd staggered slowly out the Warfield’s gilded doors. “It’s just everyone’s so fuckin’ high.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;True, audience members had passed me several joints—and I was up in the balcony seats. I briefly wondered how Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” would have fared had it debuted here, at the Warfield in San Francisco, October 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I could see plumes of smoke from below, eventually resembling a miniature diorama of a 19th century British coal town. I felt transported not so much to the past, when my fellow suburban teenagers and I would gather in secret to worship at the altar of Sleep and street-grade marijuana, but to an eternal present, a “riff-filled land” as Cisneros says. A land where the riffs never end because they’re slow enough to last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The Bay Area Council Economic Institute (BACEI), a local think tank focused on economic and policy issues, released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/files/pdf/BACEI_Housing_10_2016.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; detailing the top 20 policies that impact affordability in the city of San Francisco. The analysis considers affordability based on meeting the conventional 30% of income metric, ranking policies based on their net impact to affordability.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policies That Help Affordability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The report finds that policies influencing supply are the most helpful, either by directly increase the housing supply or accelerating the increase of housing production.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The single most important contributor to affordability, according to the analysis, is expediting the completion of major developments. Large projects such as those slated for Treasure Island, Hunter’s Point, Park Merced, and Mission Rock, together represent over 25,000 units in the pipeline, of which over 6,000 will be below-market rate. The policy overlay relates largely to ballot initiatives. The Mission Rock development, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/City_of_San_Francisco_Mission_Rock_Development_Initiative,_Proposition_D_(November_2015&quot;&gt;required voter input in 2015&lt;/a&gt;) to increase the area’s height limits, since an earlier proposition prevented the city from allowing development on Port property from exceeding 40 feet unless voters approved the increase.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering of Mission Rock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Other supply-based policies the think tank reports will help include streamlining local approval of housing, easing building restrictions, legalizing accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, and facilitating of micro-units.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many of these have received attention at the state level, with varying degrees of success. Governor Jerry Brown proposed legislation earlier this year to streamline infill projects that contain a portion of affordable units, creating a “by right” process for those development proposals. According to the BACEI report, though it was never voted on, the policy would create 16,594 new market-rate units and decrease prices by 5.94%, which would make housing affordable in the technical sense, at 30% of income or less, to more than 11,000 households.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Then there are those policies that tackle affordability more directly, such as affordable housing density bonus programs and funding for below-market rate housing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco_Creation_of_a_Housing_Trust_Fund,_Proposition_C_(November_2012&quot;&gt;Proposition C&lt;/a&gt;), which passed in 2012, created a Housing Trust fund to invest in affordable housing. The city estimates that this fund will help develop 9,000 permanently affordable units, assuming developers leverage the money with government subsidies such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credits.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policies That Hurt Affordability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, policies that reduce affordability are somewhat more varied in nature, running the gamut from building and zoning restrictions, to homesharing bans, to increased impact fees, and at the top of the list, the elimination of rent control.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The elimination of rent control is particularly noteworthy, given the abundance of economic literature on the negative consequences of rent control, which BACEI acknowledges. However, while ending rent control would result in a small supply shock, this would be massively outweighed by the loss of affordable units. The conversion of a rent-controlled unit to market-rate doesn’t inherently mean the household in question will no longer have an affordable home, since household income must also be accounted for. As a proxy for this information, BACEI applies 10%, based on the percentage of renters paying between 25% and 29% of their rent in 1998, to the number of total rent controlled units to tabulate the number of affordable units that would be lost - 17,200.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering of 1515 South Van Ness, a project with 25% Below Market Rate units bitterly opposed by some Mission District residents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Other harmful policies discussed are construction moratoria in the Mission district, including both a hypothetical indefinite ban on market-rate housing and the 18 month halt proposed by last year’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Moratorium-on-new-Mission-District-housing-is-6609187.php&quot;&gt;Proposition I&lt;/a&gt;, which was soundly defeated by voters in November. However, if land use controls were changed to indefinitely prohibit market rate housing from being built in the Mission, it would result in over 11,000 households being unable to afford housing in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Inclusionary zoning requirements codified by this year’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/over-three-months-prop-c-has-reduced-production-of-affordable-housing/&quot;&gt;Proposition C&lt;/a&gt; also rank high on the list of measures that reduce housing affordability. The report notes that requiring developers to include 25% of units as BMR would increase the number of affordable units in &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; projects, but it would cause the overall housing supply to fall by 25% and end up raising prices by 3.5%. As a result, around 7,500 households would shift into an unaffordable housing situation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The report demonstrates the critical role played by policy in housing affordability, and may offer policymakers guidance on how to shape housing affordability legislation going forward, or at least provide the considerations necessary to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Business owners gathered with local politicians on a foggy corner in the Sunset District, brandishing signs opposing Proposition M, a charter amendment that could disperse the mayor’s economic policymaking powers if approved by voters.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Supervisor Aaron Peskin &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/stakeholders-search-for-common-ground-in-land-use-debate/&quot;&gt;boasted&lt;/a&gt; to J.K. Dineen of the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; that the new commission Prop M would create, a full restructuring of the current Mayor’s Offices of Housing (MOH) and Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD), would have the power to streamline housing production. Supervisor Scott Wiener later countered that Prop M’s main sponsors, namely Peskin and Supervisor Jane Kim, had opposed his legislation to streamline approvals for 100% Below Market Rate housing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Wiener, joined by Supervisor Katy Tang on the windy sidewalk in front of Uncle Benny’s Donuts, scarcely mentioned housing at today’s press conference. Tang had gathered supporters there to begin a “merchant’s walk” along commercial corridors in her District, to distribute literature and window signs in opposition to Prop M. Speaking to reporters, Tang decried the measure’s efforts to “recombine” two entirely separate offices under one commission with disparate appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“This does not make sense. We need to do whatever it is we can to support our small businesses in the most effective and efficient ways possible, so please vote No on M.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We elect the mayor to manage the executive departments,” Supervisor Wiener added. “If the mayor does a poor job, or the agencies do a poor job, the mayor can get defeated in the election, and that’s why we elect a mayor. These measures—D, H, L, and M—are all designed to strip power away from the mayor, to make offices of the mayor weaker, and decentralize power to the point where no one is accountable to the voters for anything.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;East Bay news source &lt;em&gt;Berkeleyside&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/10/20/judge-tosses-out-legal-challenge-to-berkeley-high-rise/&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that a lawsuit filed against the proposed development at 2211 Harold Way, approved by the Berkeley City Council late last year, has been dismissed by Alameda County Judge Frank Roesch. Plaintiffs Kelly Hammargren and James Hendry, unable and unwilling (respectively) to bring legal counsel, were found lacking in substantive arguments to stall the development under terms of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The judge &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2211-Harold-Way_Order-Denying-Petitions-for-Writ.pdf&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that none of the 15 claims Hammargren brought were valid in undermining the authority of the project’s approved Environmental Impact Review (EIR).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Hammargren and Hendry provided the following objections to the project’s EIR, which the judge summarily dismissed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Factually speaking, the record does not support this claim. &lt;em&gt;—Judge Roesch, in a response to one claim that essentially applies to all of them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs contended that developers had not adequately studied the effect of “extremely hazardous substances” on the nearby Berkeley City College and Berkeley High School campuses. Hammargren contended that CEQA required separate meetings with school officials to conduct such studies. Roesch disagreed, writing: “Ms. Hammargren’s suggestion that separate ‘school studies’ were required is unsupported by any authority,” and that the EIR had adequately analyzed impacts to neighboring buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Hammargren’s brief further argued that the city had surreptitiously avoided any environmental review regarding the schools because Harold Way had been improperly classified as “infill.”  This claim rested on the plaintiff’s assertion that infill development requires on-site affordable housing, whereas Harold Way will instead contribute $10.5 million to Berkeley’s Housing Trust Fund. Judge Roesch writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ms. Hammargren cites no authority for the proposition that a residential project may not be built unless it includes low income housing or that the building of market rate housing alone is in violation of CEQA or any other state statute or section of the municipal code. Her argument therefore lacks merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;According to Hammargren, the EIR completely omitted any evaluation of earthquake safety on part of the project site. This categorically dismisses a significant part of the EIR. The plaintiff, Roesch writes, “is factually incorrect in her assertion that the issue of seismic impacts was ignored…The EIR reports that all fill soils will be removed from the site during excavation and that such removal will eliminate potential seismic hazards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs argued that 2211 Harold Way exceeded downtown Berkeley’s 180-foot height limits by 5 feet. The judge found that the project was carefully designed to remain within the exceptions specified by Berkeley’s Municipal Code (BMC): “the project height of 180 feet plus five foot high parapet
complies with zoning requirements… Accordingly, the project does not violate the height limitations of the BMC (and in fact appears to have been carefully designed to be within the City’s height restrictions).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A proposed alternative, according to Hammargren, was rejected by the City due to a finding of financial feasibility which she claims was based on an inaccurate reporting of land costs. “The record of findings indicates that financial feasibility was only one of several findings that supported City’s rejection of the Preservation Alternative. Even assuming, counterfactually, that financial feasibility was the sole reason City rejected this alternative, the July 2015' pro forma to which Ms. Hammargren refers was not the only information on which the City based its determination of financial infeasibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Hammargren claims that the EIR did not conduct a “mandatory” study of the project’s impacts on sewage infrastructure. According to the judge, the plaintiff “argues that the EIR does not contain any site-specific analysis of the project’s sewage impact. This is incorrect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The final claim the judge addresses contends that the nearly 60 year-old Hinks building, adjacent to the historically landmarked Shattuck Hotel, was improperly slated for demolition. Roesch writes that the Berkeley Municipal Code did indeed allow for demolition of certain historical landmarks. The City’s actions, including a decision by the Landmarks and Preservation commission, “entirely undercut Ms. Hammergren’s argument that the Hinks Building is historical landmark that may not be demolished.” Roesch continues: “The City has complied with the requirements under its ordinance to demolish landmarked building and Ms. Hammargren has made no argument that such findings were not properly made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Hammargren and Hendry have 60 days to file an appeal, and have told &lt;em&gt;Berkeleyside&lt;/em&gt; that they have not yet decided if they will do so.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;On Monday evening, The Swedish American Hall was packed to the rafters with civic-minded San Franciscans. Hosted by Planning Commissioner Dennis Richards and Enrique Landa, the night’s debate featured a number of local ballot measures related to land use as understood by district supervisors, community activists, and other representative stakeholders. &lt;em&gt;BAMO&lt;/em&gt; reports the highlights (and lowlights) below.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prop M - Aaron Peskin Takes On...SF Chronicle Reporter J.K. Dineen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Aaron Peskin was slated to debate Supervisor Scott Wiener on Prop M, a measure to create a new commission to oversee two more new commissions (seriously), but scheduling conflicts for both parties got in the way. Instead, Peskin responded to questions from moderator J.K. Dineen, a reporter for the &lt;em&gt;SF Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Peskin, no amateur rhetorician, started with an exercise in exclusivity: “If you think everything is working when it comes to housing in this city, don’t vote for Prop M.” The process today is too opaque, Peskin asserted, and excludes the community. Prop M would make the creation of new housing more transparent, and the D3 supervisor went as far as arguing that the bureaucratic measure would “streamline the process.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Interesting,” Mr. Dineen replied, prompting laughter from the venue.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the broader batch of measures DHLM came up, which are designed to pull power away from the mayor’s office. Peskin said we should vote yes on all of them, citing the Planning Commission as an example of a governing body that functions better when executive authority is limited. Lastly, Peskin didn’t miss a chance to take aim at Ron Conway, who has helped finance opposition to DHLM, and closed with a call to “Follow the Money”.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Scott Wiener arrived later in the night, facing J.K. Dineen’s attempt at “channeling” Aaron Peskin. Dineen asked Wiener how he responded to the notion that housing process happens in “dark, smoky rooms…” evocative of the “opaque” process Peskin described earlier. Wiener responded that measures to debilitate the mayor’s office, including D, H, and L, are “incredibly cynical” and not good government. An independent commission to oversee housing and development, such as the one proposed by Prop M, would slow down the construction of new housing, not speed it up as Peskin suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Wiener also pointed out that supporters of Prop M had opposed his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Affordable-housing-legislation-goes-to-Supes-6504387.php&quot;&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; to remove conditional use requirements for 100% affordable housing developments, a proposal that would directly speed up the process of building affordable housing. The audienc seemed especially receptive to this point.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BAMO&lt;/em&gt; awards this round to Supervisor Wiener.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prop X - District 6 Supervisor Jane Kim Makes a Case for PDR Against SFHAC Executive Director Tim Colen’s Call for More Housing, Period&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In the second round, moderated by Kim-Mai Cutler, Jane Kim made some fairly compelling points about the need to protect PDR space, a land use category that stands for “Production/Distribution/Repair” and covers things like auto repair, small manufacturing, and arts activities. Prop X would do two things: 1) require a conditional use authorization for demolition of a PDR space, and 2) require the developer to replace a portion of the space with PDR.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kim argued that her district has lost 970,000 square feet of PDR space in the past five years, which represents a substantial amount of middle-income jobs, especially for those without college degrees. Kim didn’t necessarily address the point that this would increase the cost of building housing, but argued that without government intervention, the market would dictate the building of market-rate housing and office space only, since those use-types command the highest profits. Arts and manufacturing spaces, like those covered by PDR, yield lower returns and would not be represented if it were left up to the market alone.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Tim Colen, Executive Director of SFHAC, rebutted that the city has already planned for the loss of PDR, quite literally, in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf-planning.org/sites/default/files/FileCenter/Documents/3991-EN_Final-EIR_Part-1_Intro-Sum.pdf&quot;&gt;Eastern Neighborhood Plan&lt;/a&gt;. According to Colen, the Mission and SoMa districts are pretty much “on schedule” in their projected loss of PDR space. Further, complex land use decisions should not be made by voters, particularly when no analysis of the PDR requirement has been performed. Prop X is “designed to restrict the construction of market-rate housing,” Colen argued, and would lead to underutilized sites like warehouses and parking lots remaining unproductive. A better model would be that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/100-Hooper-site-acquired-for-complex-to-house-6371561.php&quot;&gt;used by the City College of Arts at 100 Hooper&lt;/a&gt;, a hybrid development model with higher floors subsidizing ground floor PDR, rather than the developer.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kim acknowledged that the legislation could be amended by a two-thirds vote from the Board of Supervisors, and a BMR-like model with in-lieu fees or off-site development as options might come in trailing legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BAMO&lt;/em&gt; acknowledges the need for some level of PDR protection, but recommends a No vote on Prop X.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prop O:  Angelo King Defends Hunter’s Point Development Against Calvin Welch Finger Wagging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The most unexpected performance of the night came from someone who wasn’t even supposed to be there, with Prop O supporter Angelo King taking the place of Former Supervisor Sophie Maxwell of District 10.  King faced off with Calvin Welch in defense of Prop O, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfgov.org/elections/sites/default/files/Documents/candidates/Office%20Development%20in%20Candlestick%20Point%20and%20Hunters%20Point%20Legal%20Text.pdf&quot;&gt;somewhat complicated&lt;/a&gt; result of previous ballot initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Prop O must be understood in the context of the city’s 1986 ballot measure, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-law-blocks-tech-boom-expansion-5652707.php&quot;&gt;Prop M&lt;/a&gt;, which restricted the amount of approved office space in a year to 950,000 square feet. In 2008, Prop G passed, which “would establish city policy to encourage timely development” of Hunter’s Point. In line with Prop G, the city wants to move forward with redevelopment of the area, but in order to do so has to exempt the project from Prop M’s 950k sq. ft cap.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Welch argued that the area is that only 3 million square feet have been subject to environmental review, with the remaining 2 million getting a free pass at approval. Welch also voiced major concerns about the lack of transit to this area, pointing out the an additional 40,000 transit trips per day would be added as a result of the new office space. He called Prop O “the wrong measure in the wrong part of the world at the wrong time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;King had strong rebuttals lined up. First, the developer (Lennar) is entitled to 3 million square feet of the land only, and there is no automatic trigger of the additional 2 million. This would require approval from the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure. King further explained the transit issue as a chicken-and-egg problem, since transit won’t necessarily come before an area is developed. We wouldn’t expect SFMTA to build “five bus lanes to nowhere”. The project is a thirty-year plan, Angelo reminded Welch; it is not going to happen tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As a resident of the district himself, Angelo’s remarks were particularly persuasive, especially given Welch’s insistence that this project did not represent “community” development.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Calvin huffed and puffed, but it was Angelo who brought the house down Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prop U - Leah Pimentel Appeals to the Need for Middle Income Housing Opposite Peter Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The city’s inclusionary housing program is designed primarily to reserve units for low-income residents, or those making around half of the area median income (“AMI”). Prop U would open the BMR system to middle income households, or those earning up to 110% of AMI.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Leah Pimentel, arguing in favor of Prop U, shared her personal middle class story in San Francisco, recounting holidays characterized by “over-time” and “time-and-a-half”. Prop U would give families like hers, who make “a little too much,” a chance to stay in San Francisco. Peter Cohen, an affordable housing organization director, countered that Prop U was not an “additive” program, but would instead take housing away from low-income households who need it the most. Cohen added that the city has offered middle income households relief in the form of down payment assistance from last year’s Prop A bond.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BAMO&lt;/em&gt; sides with Peter Cohen on this one - Prop U is not good affordable housing policy.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Last month, we &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/is-a-nonprofit-developer-laundering-money-to-local-campaigns/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on a city ethics complaint against John Elberling, director of the affordable housing developer TODCO Group, LLC. Elberling is accused of funneling money from his subsidized rental assets through another LLC, the Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium (YNBC), to fund political campaigns. In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Pre-election-opening-for-Warm-Springs-BART-looks-9981990.php&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, Elberling largely admitted to doing so, and argued that nothing illegal or unethical had occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Not everyone agrees with Elberling. Supervisor Mark Farrell released a press statement today, calling for a federal investigation into YNBC, labeled a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_money&quot;&gt;dark money&lt;/a&gt; shell entity” for contributing $375,000 to local ballot measure campaigns in 2016. YNBC’s election mailer was a driving force behind the campaign to pass Proposition C in June, an increase in Below Market Rental requirements for private development co-sponsored by Supervisors Jane Kim and Aaron Peskin.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Profiting from taxpayer subsidy and funneling those profits into local political campaigns is reprehensible,” Farrell said in his statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In a press conference at &lt;em&gt;BAMO&lt;/em&gt; offices today, Tim Colen, Executive Director of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition, reiterated the sentiment. “Who knows if it’s legal or not, but it stinks,” Colen said. “It is so frustrating to learn that housing units built by taxpayers, through clever financial engineering, is being used as a cash cow for political slush funds…to support political measures that are directly harmful to tenants,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Colen, joined by Supervisor Scott Wiener, insisted that the campaign funds should have been reinvested into existing tenants, and could also be used to build more affordable housing. YBNC’s funding mostly came from a profit earned when Elberling refinanced several TODCO properties,&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Elberling conceded as much in his interview with the Chronicle, remaining adamantly without remorse. After refinancing netted several million dollars, TODCO found itself with “a big surplus that we didn’t need for regular expenses, so we funded our ... Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium to do community advocacy”—specifically, by allotting at least $300,000 per year for campaign contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In this election cycle, YBNC has contributed $149,000 to the Proposition X campaign, a measure setting high requirements to preserve industrial space, spearheaded by Supervisor Jane Kim. $83,000 has gone to support Propositions D, H, L, and M, four ballot measures Supervisor Aaron Peskin has championed to create special elections for Supervisor vacancies (D), create a Public Advocate office (H), and reorganize existing executive offices in committees with supervisorial appointments (L and M).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“These four measures are a fraud and a scam,” said Tony Winnicker, and aide to Mayor Ed Lee who has taken a leave of absence to campaign against D, H, L, and M. “Now we know they are primarily funded by money that originated with taxpayers, intended to benefit affordable housing and low-income tenants,” he continued. “These measures have nothing to do with sunshine and reform.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The state’s Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) has opened an investigation in response to the complaint. Elberling insisted that everything he did was legal, and not a defrauding of taxpayers. In his estimation, the properties were originally financed by federal and state funding decades ago, which have since been paid off (indeed, yielding a net profit after refinancing).&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Oakland-based development firm &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nautilusgrp.com/&quot;&gt;Nautilus Group&lt;/a&gt; will soon undergo the challenge of building the country’s second tallest modular apartment complex, a 350-foot building with 176 dwelling units at the 14th &amp;amp; Webster intersection in downtown Oakland. The mixed-use project, featuring office space and ground-floor retail typical of downtown developments, will receive a 20% density bonus for including on-site affordable housing, with rents price-indexed for middle- and/or low-income households.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radurban.com/1433-webster&quot;&gt;renderings&lt;/a&gt; have already been released, the developer likely faces a long road ahead. A 32-story modular high-rise project at Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn has faced a litany of problems since its inception, including but not limited to competing lawsuits between the developer and contractor. Stalled for years, the B2 tower at Atlantic Yards is &lt;a href=&quot;http://citylimits.org/2015/08/31/documents-reveal-woes-at-pioneering-atlantic-yards-building/&quot;&gt;finally complete&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the world, there is more optimism regarding modular construction. For example, a 54-story tower was built in Chengshe, China &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-3cca82c0-af80-4c3a-8a79-84fda5015115&quot;&gt;in just 19 days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;RAD Urban, a partner in Nautilus’s vertically-integrated business model, released a promotional video earlier this year boasting of “up to 50%” speedier construction with their pre-fabricated modular designs. Nautilus recently completed “Garden Village,” a much smaller &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2013/10/17/innovative-housing-with-rooftop-farms-set-for-southside/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; at the Dwight &amp;amp; Fulton intersection in Berkeley, featuring a rooftop garden and a total absence of private parking spots.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The project will be heard before Oakland’s Design Review Committee, a subcommittee of the Planning Commission, on October 26th.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A staff report from the City of Oakland is expected later in the week. This article will be updated accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Dear Jane,&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It really troubles me that you would attack Gary McCoy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154252742119219&amp;amp;set=a.283755944218.144513.569399218&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;calling him a liar&lt;/a&gt; and paid by Scott Wiener to say what he said in the Equality California advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I was asked if I would consider sharing my experience in advertisement on this issue, but I have agreed with Jennifer Friedenbach and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beyondchron.org/sfs-best-worst-ballot-measures/&quot;&gt;Beyond Chron's viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; on Proposition Q, and even a few days ago, I donated money to Amy Weiss and the St. Francis Homelessness Challenge.  But now my trust is damaged after seeing the advertisement against Gary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I've had plenty of political disagreements with Gary, I am progressive, he is moderate, but we both share a profound and common bond, in that we are both gay, recovering crystal meth addicts, HIV positive, who struggled to overcome homelessness, hopelessness, and unemployment.   That's why after workinghard and donating the $500 max to get Aaron Peskin elected, I reached out Julie Christensen after the last election, and told her Gary would make a great addition to the Shelter Monitoring Committee, of which I was Vice Chair at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I spoke to the Mayor's Office too, and was very happy when I learned that Gary was appointed by the Mayor to serve on the committee, as were other fellow progressive members. As a progressive, I value different viewpoints from my own, and I saw a great opportunity to bring Moderates and Progressives together on the Shelter Monitoring Committee, especially because we found ourselves with great moderate allies in the Board of Supervisors and on the Rules Committee, especially with Katy Tang who backed us 100% as we fought for and worked to address the plight of domestic violence victims in homeless shelters.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Jane Kim,  please apologize to Gary. Your actions have actually led me to reconsider my choice to vote no on Q. When our political leaders are unwilling to listen to real homeless people, and use us as pawns to score political points against their opponents, I find it hard to toe the progressive party line. Attacking a formerly homeless person, one who is gay, HIV positive, and a recovering addict, who has, after many years of struggle, managed to finally land a full time job with living wage and benefits, and sign a lease for an apartment just a few weeks ago - this is not acceptable to me.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Before today, I always believed whoever won would make a great State Senator.  Today, I am left thinking only Scott Wiener has the requisite decency, honesty and integrity to serve in the Senate. Even though I often disagree with Scott, at least I know he will always listen, be polite, and be honest about his viewpoints and how he arrived to such viewpoints. Even Tim Redmond has mentioned how courteous and respectful Scott Wiener is.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Jane, I hope you can apologize to Gary. Attack Scott all you want, but please don't attack formerly homeless people because they political viewpoints differ from yours. Please don't silence or lie about homeless people because their political views don't agree with your viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The Legislative Analyst Office’s is back with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/212&quot;&gt;more findings&lt;/a&gt; on the impact of high housing costs, this time in relation to workers, job opportunity, and economic mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;According to LAO, California used to be a place where economic opportunity was shared across the state. Areas with lots of good jobs also had plentiful housing, so low-income workers could move to those places and access better, higher-paying jobs. Between 1940 and 1960, the state experienced a “convergence” of income, where incomes grew fastest where they were the lowest, and grew the slowest where they were already high. In other words, low income residents generally became better off economically, and the pay of higher-income households didn’t change much.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, though, this trend has reversed. Higher income residents are actually moving in the opposite direction toward places with lower wages (but also cheaper housing). While this might be because households end up getting more out of their paychecks by moving to more affordable parts of the state, LAO finds this turns out not to be the case. Even after factoring in lower housing costs, migrating households are still worse off because lower wages more than offset those savings. Rather, LAO suggests, residents may leave simply because they cannot find housing in those expensive metro areas at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The LAO recommends the governor place checks on local authority when it comes to housing approvals, since many communities fail to fully account for the impact of their decision not to build adequate housing. But if Governor Brown’s attempt at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/08/unions-against-gov-browns-as-of-right-housing-plan.html&quot;&gt;by-right housing solution&lt;/a&gt; is any indication, state intervention may still be a long way away.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tenderlion.org/about/&quot;&gt;Tenderlion.org&lt;/a&gt; and is reprinted here with permission from the author. It has been edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The IFD Fizzle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It’s tough trying to sell something with the moniker &lt;em&gt;Infrastructure Finance District&lt;/em&gt;, or IFD.  IFDs are a way to capture the increase in local taxes so they can be reinvested in an area over a prescribed period of time. Tax increment financing was considered as one of the ways to pay the tab for the Central Market Economic Strategy &lt;a href=&quot;https://tenderlion.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/central-marketeconomic-strategy-november-2011.pdf&quot;&gt;(CMES)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The strategy was straightforward: We all can see the surge of investment in mid-Market coming and the commensurate surge in taxes collected by the city.  This is a way the city – having successfully attracted tech companies to the area – can reinvest and leverage those extra gains in the local community.  Everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As director of the Tenderloin Economic Development Project, I lobbied for the passage of an IFD.  I made the rounds to my neighboring community organizations, many of which signed on, and gave a tax-increment 101 presentation to an audience of residents and other stakeholders at the Tenderloin Futures Collaborative, which at the time was facilitated by much-loved Tenderloin legend Reverend Glenda Hope.  But the IFD campaign fizzled.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I could not get the support of the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation (TNDC), the Tenderloin’s largest landlord.  IFDs did not provide funding for new construction of affordable housing, a deal killer for TNDC.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This struck me as unfortunate for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;•    The Tenderloin’s housing stock is already affordable and protected, much of it owned and managed by TNDC.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;•    TNDC residents would have been beneficiaries of neighborhood improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;•    IFD legislation did allow for funds to be used to build replacement housing, which was an opportunity to rebuild some fucked-up SRO hotels like, say, the notorious Warfield Hotel on the corner of Turk &amp;amp; Taylor, or the entire eastside of 100 Taylor Street for that matter (built for the housing needs of the late 1900s), into high-density, high-quality, mixed-income housing two blocks from the Powell Street BART/MUNI station.  The Warfield Hotel’s historic plaque doesn’t do shit for poor people or the city’s twenty-first century urgent need for more housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;•    In 2012 we voted for Proposition C to create a $1.5 billion dollar trust fund for affordable housing, so a much-needed war chest was already moving forward for housing. In comparison, nothing – zero – was available to invest in community facilities: homeless shelters; arts &amp;amp; education centers; recreation centers; parks; a new neighborhood YMCA; an SF community college campus; satellite libraries; streetscape improvements to improve public safety at several notoriously dangerous intersections; all these investments in community could have been paid for and/or catalyzed by an IFD.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that California based affordable housing developer Mercy Housing, directed by Doug Shoemaker, said yes.   Also saying yes were:&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://allstars.org/&quot;&gt;All Stars Project&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco Bay Area; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linesballet.org/&quot;&gt;Alonzo King LINES Ballet&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://counterpulse.org/&quot;&gt;CounterPulse&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.demarillac.org/&quot;&gt;De Marillac Academy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theintersection.org/&quot;&gt;Intersection for the Arts&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kunst-stoff.org/ksarts&quot;&gt;Kunst-Stoff&lt;/a&gt; arts &amp;amp; dance company; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lhtsf.org/&quot;&gt;Lorraine Hansberry Theater&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.luggagestoregallery.org/&quot;&gt;Luggage Store Gallery &amp;amp; 509 Cultural Center&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tlcbd.org/&quot;&gt;North of Market Tenderloin Community Benefit District&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncclf.org/&quot;&gt;Northern California Community Loan Fund&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfcamerawork.org/&quot;&gt;SF Camerawork&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ymcasf.org/locations/shih-yu-lang-central-ymca&quot;&gt;Shih Yu-Lang Central YMCA&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stanthonysf.org/&quot;&gt;St. Anthony’s&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kidsclub.org/find-a-club/tenderloin-clubhouse/&quot;&gt;Tenderloin Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tedpsf.org/&quot;&gt;Tenderloin Economic Development Project&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uchastings.edu/&quot;&gt;UC Hastings School of Law&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vydc.org/&quot;&gt;Vietnamese Youth Development Center&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://youthspeaks.org/&quot;&gt;Youth Speaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A pretty impressive line-up – arts, affordable housing, education, public health, business, nonprofit lending, youth development, social services – all represented here.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I couldn’t get ahold of Hospitality House to add them to the list.  Given that mid-Market/Tenderloin is the epicenter of San Francisco’s homeless population it would only be appropriate to dedicate a portion of captured tax funds to invest in whatever facilities could help meet their needs.  Each year, responses seem limited to service providers’ annual operating budget add-back requests that keep us as indentured servants and do nothing to change the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Perhaps at some point this status quo just became our norm and we no longer even see or question it: a kind of collective sleepwalking.  Except, of course, for poor families in the Tenderloin, they definitely still notice it because they have to live with it. They don’t get evenings and weekends off.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;There’s little “active” left in the “activist,” it seems to me.  We are lulled to sleep by bi-weekly paychecks and the droning sound of the BART train at the end of each weekday as we head back to our comfortable homes in East Bay neighborhoods where the concentration of poverty in the Tenderloin is far, far away.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Kim wouldn’t support an IFD; perhaps she was getting pushback from other sources.  I remember her saying we had to be careful about improving the neighborhood, which pretty much sums up her entire tenure as district supervisor.  I don’t get how building neighborhood art centers or parklets or a community college are a threat against the backdrop of an enormous inventory of protected housing, much of which, by the way, is dangerously substandard and in need of rebuilding.   A perplexing Progressive paradox – over five years living and working in the Tenderloin and I still don’t see the progress in Progressive.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While Mayor Ed Lee initially championed an IFD only to deliver a disappearing act instead, I often think the IFD campaign failure is largely on me.  I made the naïve assumption that delivering a well-crafted letter – co-authored by the Tenderloin Economic Development Project and the Northern California Community Loan Fund – signed by numerous and influential stakeholder organizations would grab the attention of city hall and elicit a response.  It doesn’t work that way; what was needed was an organized political campaign – a machine – that worked the chambers in city hall.  I was a newbie and didn’t know how to work the politics.  One dude getting his neighbor nonprofits – however impressive they may be – to sign a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tenderlion.org/2015/03/06/cbos-letter-to-supervisor-kim-and-mayor-ed-lee/&quot;&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Witness what &lt;a href=&quot;http://arts4bayarea.nationbuilder.com/allocation_of_hotel_tax_fund&quot;&gt;Arts for A Better Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; is doing to build support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://bettersf.com/&quot;&gt;Proposition S&lt;/a&gt;, a super important moment for restoring arts funding and improving services for homeless families.  That’s how you bring important initiatives from concept to reality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A recent op-ed in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Examiner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tells us that “Prop D is all about democracy,” which is pretty punchy as far as headlines go, in a kool-aid kind of way. Warning us against a present imbalance of power and overreach by City Hall insiders in certain district supervisorial seat replacements, the piece insists that Prop D will correct this imbalance and restore constitutional principles by giving power “back” to voters.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But Prop D isn’t about improving local democracy at all, and voters already have a say in the situation it applies to. What Prop D is trying to “fix” is the relatively uncommon circumstance of responding to a vacant Supervisor Seat, by supposedly shifting power away from the mayor and to voters in that district.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The way it works now, if a supervisor leaves his or her seat - as is likely to happen this November after Scott Wiener or Jane Kim wins the State Senate race - the Mayor is responsible for appointing a new supervisor, who can then run in the next general election. Prop D would change this to allow the Mayor to appoint only an interim Supervisor, and create a special election to vote in the new supervisor. The interim appointee by the mayor would not be allowed to run in this special election, although they could run in the next general election.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At first glance, that change seems to make sense. Why should the mayor get to select a district supervisor, rather than district residents themselves? Doesn’t that just open the door for political favoritism or some shady mayor motives?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Not really. If voters don’t like the mayor’s appointment, they can vote them out come election-time. And they have. Two of the last three mayoral appointees - Julie Christensen of District 3 and Christina Olague of District 5 - lost in the subsequent general elections. The supposed benefit of incumbency doesn’t seem to be an issue here.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;If interim appointee doesn’t have to face voters, it would be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely that they will put the mayor’s interests first. For the time they hold office, the appointee will answer to the mayor with no accountability to voters. Will this necessarily lead to some negative outcome for the district at issue? No, but if the goal of this measure is to increase accountability for a district leader, this seems like the wrong way to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Moreover, special elections generally get very low turnout, which means the results skew...well, they skew in some non-representative direction, essentially.  Compared to a general election, like the one you would vote in for a vacant supervisor seat now, special elections are actually less democratic. Again, if the goal here is more democracy, this change won’t get us there.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The current system works, and doesn’t pose any actual threat to democracy. We already elect supervisors in vacancy situations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Prop D would just add a costly, unnecessary election with low voter participation and create more problems than it would solve - which is hard to avoid when the measure creates its own problem.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Oji Edutainment is serenity personified. With his red-tinted locks tied back, he greets me with a smile of eternal grace and warmth as I drag my bicycle into an unobtrusive corner of his kitchen. I’ve biked over three miles from the Pittsburg BART station to his apartment, absorbing impossibly beautiful hillside views along an impossibly narrow bike lane. On more residential streets, cawing roosters and charming church yard sales remind me of family trips to Maryland’s Amish country, home of America’s finest pretzels.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Oji moved here for peace of mind, to raise his family in a calm environment close to nature. I don’t blame him.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Under the moniker of Oji &amp;amp; The Ascension Team, Oji (rhymes with “eye”) has produced sprawling, lyrical epics that draw from a vast tapestry of influences. He uses platforms like Soundcloud and the online exchange platform Fiverr, where people can seek bids for any sort of service with the standard bid of $5, to find like-minded collaborators from around the world, including Malian rappers singing in Wolof. His production style is deeply psychedelic yet through-provoking, packing enough surprises to keep listeners on their toes.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;From folk to techno, jazz to African rhythms, Oji’s newest project “Ziko Shezi &amp;amp; The Umbilini” even features vocal percussion from a South Indian classical singer in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though I’m a total stranger to them, his five children greet me like a cousin, and while Oji finds a movie for them to watch, three of them abandon their electric train set to climb over me and play catch. I’m almost embarrassed of my own childhood: misbehaved as I was, I still haven’t read any of my parents’ books. Meanwhile, Maat (age: 9), Ba (8), Ase (7), Bodhi (5), and Ptah (3) are paragons of patience, joyously dancing to their father’s music but quick to calm down and listen when he asks them to give us some space. Later he tells me that Bodhi was born in the bathtub just a few feet away from us, before the midwife could arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author caves into demands to take a selfie with Ase, Bodhi, and Ptah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Oji wears many hats, but he doesn’t see it that way. He’s a rapper, a father, a painter, producer, filmmaker—what’s the difference? “I just like to keep things interesting, try something new with every project,” he says as he shows me his home studio. His paintings—many purely abstract, others vaguely forming the shapes of human faces—surround his workstation, on which a small laptop and keyboard emit sound from a single studio monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Indeed, though always branching out in new “interesting” terrain, his work all coexists in a singular oeuvre: paintings and animations are often a part of his music videos, and visual work often inspires his music. It’s rare to find someone who radiates pure expression, a creative life-force oozing out into the world through every medium imaginable. Sometimes Oji calls it “divinity” and I’m inclined to agree. An autodidact to the core, he learned everything from music production to martial arts, painting, and 3D animation on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DuxzgP7BF7M&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

“My interests are very diverse, and not many people share them,” Oji says with a notable absence of the disappointment one might expect from such a statement. “Learning the spiritual aspects of your voice, like harmonizing with something outside of yourself, empowers you to connect your body with the world around you.” He hummed a meditative &quot;ahhh&quot; sound to demonstrate. “Your own voice, in my experience, is your spirit in free form.”

His freestyle rapping often includes random syllables, a “made-up language” with no meaning beyond its own Being-in-Time.



&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ruAIZ7cH8iA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It’s very much like abstract painting,” he says of his invented speech. “It has no meaning except the meaning you give it, so it can mean different things at different times…It’s always new.” It’s actually quite shocking to go from mere listener to audience in his presence—initially soft-spoken and calm, his rapping voice is bold, measured, electric. Each sound receives great care and enunciation; Oji’s eyes light up like someone whose brilliant new invention will change the world. It’s trancelike, almost as if he’s possessed, the energy is so sudden and unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;He compares the tradition of freestyle rap to the vocal percussion known as &lt;em&gt;konnakol&lt;/em&gt;, a South Indian classical technique prominently featured on his upcoming Umbilini album &lt;em&gt;Glossolalia&lt;/em&gt; (the scientific term for speaking in tongues).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Oji was born and raised in the Hunters Point neighborhood of San Francisco. Many of his music videos are filmed there, but he’s fairly reticent about his time in the city save for a mention that he “had more anger” back then. His uncles formed part of a “pop-lock-n-strut” dance crew in the Fillmore neighborhood, but artistic pursuits were otherwise rare in his family.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though formerly an artist-in-residence at the Shipyard art studios in Hunters Point, he retains little connection to the artistic community in the area save for some family members still living in Bayview. “I still feel like a tourist out there,” he says of his visits home. We both agree Pittsburg unquestionably has better rent and better weather.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I got bored speaking about the same things,” Oji says of his early days practicing freestyle rap. “It was kind of to free myself from the environment, and now I do it for beauty—to find inspiration, divinity. The more you do it, the more energy builds up and starts shining.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though less locally-focused now, Oji has shined his light on local artists such as Oakland chanteuse &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/maya-songbird-writes-music-for-the-wild-and-weird/Content?oid=4647422&quot;&gt;Maya Songbird&lt;/a&gt;, producing several songs on her &lt;a href=&quot;https://ratskinrecords.bandcamp.com/album/maya-songbird-queen-of-darkness-ep&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Queen of Darkness&lt;/em&gt; EP&lt;/a&gt;. Like Oji, Maya’s aesthetic often shows shamanistic tendencies, setting anthems of sexual empowerment against a backdrop of Ankh pendants and black cats. More recently, he performed at the New Parish in Oakland with the prolific R&amp;amp;B icon George Anne Muldrow. Oji praises hercollaboration with New York producer Bilal as a powerful, groundbreaking achievement in vocal performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYAW_njEoBI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;





&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/G0o-q1_xUSk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Oji frequently collaborates with Sacramento rapper First Degree The D.E., who also interviewed Oji about his alien abduction &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.firstdegreethede.com/2014/09/15/bay-area-rapper-abducted-by-aliens&quot;&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; at Russian River several years ago. We pause the interview to watch First Degree's newest music video and I relinquish all journalistic objectivity: it’s simply incredible. We spend the next hour or so diving through a YouTube wormhole as he shows me his favorite artists, including the rapper Art Melody from Burkina Faso.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/veywomI73N8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The challenge for him is to carve out a niche in the ranks of Bay Area hip-hop by learning from the masters who rep the region worldwide. “I grew up listening to artists like Andre Nickatina, Mac Dre, and there’s a lot to learn from those guys in building a fan-base and establishing a brand, particularly with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4FSR0IR-DY&quot;&gt;JT The Bigga Figga&lt;/a&gt;. I would love to be a part of the music industry, because I feel like I have a lot to bring to the table. Ultimately it’s about working with people who believe in what I do.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Eventually I speculate aloud, as we talk about his successful and less-successful efforts to break into the music business, if he consciously intended to speak more about spiritual matters than pressing social issues in his music. Would he, in other words, end up making a song about recent police murders in Bayview, or Black Lives Matter in general, as many current artists including The D.E. have done?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The answer is vexingly simple: his art is his life, his health, his being. “I know exactly what you mean. I’ve done a lot of healing since I’ve been here, and there’s still more healing to do. Detoxifying--&lt;em&gt;emotionally&lt;/em&gt;, you know. But I understand each side of the spectrum. One of my favorite artists is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Manson&quot;&gt;Marilyn Manson&lt;/a&gt;; at the other end of the spectrum, there’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afropunk.com/group/eatmadveg/forum/topics/starchetarians-by-super-nova&quot;&gt;Super Nova Slom&lt;/a&gt;, who writes about holistic health.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;After a long, reflective pause: “Stability is what I aim for, whether it’s through the breath, or learning how life is sacred. I try not to take anyone or anything for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This uniquely Californian trope, that of unfettered self-expression as a radical act of protest—not just navel-gazing, but out of deep reverence for the whole web of life—feels like something I’ve been searching for ever since I moved here.  Now after meeting Maya and Oji, I’ve finally found what was here all along.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Very few artists strike such a tender balance between absolute confidence in what they do, and the humility to accept and learn from every new experience. Even fewer approach it with the same sense of conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;After our interview, the children insisted on showing me their pet geckos, as they fed them live crickets Oji had brought from the pet store that morning. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see him beaming with pride as Ase and Bodhi teamed up on the piano to show me the songs they’d been learning. Behind them stood an easel, no higher than my waist, holding a canvas splattered with paint.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Contra Costa County is stunningly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We parted ways before sunset, so Oji could take Ptah out for a short nature hike. As I biked up the hill back to the BART station, I recalled his comment about feeling like a tourist in his hometown. I don't feel that way here. Something about Pittsburg seems timeless: not the suburban cul-de-sacs lining the road, but something intangible. Something in the wind, in the golden dusk falling over the rolling hills.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;People will go far to find peace—though personally, I’m glad Oji didn’t move any farther. Here one can breathe deeply, and listen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Joshua Arce, a civil rights attorney and native of the Mission District, has ambitious plans for the area's southwestern fringe. With almost no mention of his campaign for District 9 Supervisor, he has announced plans for a broad scope of infrastructure improvements for the area south of Cesar Chavez Street, including a new BART station at 30th &amp;amp; Mission. Last night, Arce gathered before a small but mixed crowd (ideologically and otherwise, as it turned out) to present his plan in more detail and field concerns from the public.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Now dubbed the Mission South of Cesar Chavez Sustainable Neighborhood Plan, Arce’s goals are hardly new: his presentation began with a historical timeline of transit proposals in the neighborhood, most recently including plans for a BART station that were abandoned after a gloomy fiscal study in 2003. But this new plan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/joshua-arce-proposes-bart-station-housing-south-of-cesar-chavez/&quot;&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; several months ago with the support of State Assemblymember David Chiu and BART Director Nick Josefowitz, accounts for the many shortcomings that undermined older proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/arce-discusses-transit-and-housing-at-30th-and-mission/slide5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Housing aside, the plan’s most beneficial innovation is ultimately a fiscal one. Construction of the new BART station would cost $200 million, less than half of the $500 million projected in 2003—and tunnel boring would occur underground, causing no disruption to traffic on Mission Street.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Two design features are responsible for these savings: first, excavation would only have to account for 50% of the hill incline than previously estimated; second, BART would no longer consider expensive “pocket tracks” to repair trains at the station. Even though boring under Mission Street would cost more than tearing up an entire mile of the street, which the 2004 proposal estimated would last for 11 months, the overall cost is lower.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Arce’s ambitions go beyond transit, including plans to build dense, transit-oriented affordable housing around the station. Many vacant lots near the 30th &amp;amp; Mission Safeway had been identified as “opportunity sites” to build a combination of Below Market Rate (BMR) units, and market-rate construction to finance the subsidies. Unsurprisingly, this drew the ire of some neighbors who insisted that anything below 50% or 100% Affordable Housing could ease the city’s catastrophic displacement crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Before the presentation even began, I had the distinct pleasure of hearing local landlord Spike Kahn lecture &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/gwynethborden&quot;&gt;Gwyneth Borden&lt;/a&gt;, a black tenant and transit advocate, about the “gentrifying effects” a new BART station would have. The same landlord, whose campaign against the “Beast on Bryant” project earned a place on our list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/top-10-bay-area-nimby-moments-of-2016/&quot;&gt;Top 10 NIMBY Moments&lt;/a&gt; this year, has previously asserted that &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/08/big-bucks-spent-in-district-9-race/&quot;&gt;“No housing is better than gentrified housing.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When fears of gentrification were voiced during the presentation, Arce was not unprepared for criticism. He made particular note of London Breed’s recent Neighborhood Preference Ordinance, recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfist.com/2016/09/22/hud_breed_willie_kennedy.php&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; by the federal government after a tense stalemate, whichallocates preferential lottery slots in BMR dwelling units for applicants living near the project. The Department of Housing and Urban Development approved Breed’s plan only for implementation in neighborhoods seeing the most displacement of long-term residents, the Mission chiefly among them. With 1900 units built in the area, Arce argued, Breed’s legislation could help stem displacement where new subsidized housing may not otherwise help locals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/arce-discusses-transit-and-housing-at-30th-and-mission/slide1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Amid frequent check-ins on the score of the ongoing Giants game, Arce faced a deluge of criticism from a relative minority of concerned citizens, mostly focused on traffic impacts and the loss of a “chill” and “quiet” environment relative to the rest of the Mission. “We don’t want to be 16th Street,” one 30-year resident exclaimed. The woman told Arce she was there on behalf of her 91 year old neighbor, who could not walk down the hill to attend. “This needs to consider the needs of those who are mobility-impaired,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Arce remained steadfast in his assurance that the presentation was simply a “conversation” and that no plans had been set in stone. Borden added, as a candidate for BART’s Board of Directors, that BART did not plan to fund anything beyond core infrastructure maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Yet Arce also remained clear, despite some residents’ disdain for adding density to the Mission corridor, that the current status quo was the least attractive option. “The easiest thing to do here is to do nothing. We need to think about what will happen if we do that. Will the situation get worse, or will it get better?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Arce additionally noted that his campaign had refused to receive any donations from real estate developers, in order to “negotiate the best deals” for affordable housing. The comment was undoubtedly an implicit jab at his opponent Hillary Ronen. Ronen, who has raised nearly twice as much funding as Arce, received &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/08/big-bucks-spent-in-district-9-race/&quot;&gt;$2,700 from registered lobbyists&lt;/a&gt;, including one representing the developer for the “Beast on Bryant” project. When some members of the public urged a greater proportion of subsidized units, he typically responded that his goal was to have as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Borden again chimed in with qualified optimism regarding the city’s growth. “Unless we build a moat around the city, people aren’t going to stop coming here,” she said. “As much as we want to focus on what’s impeding our quality of life &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, we also need to plan long-term...The city hasn’t planned for growth, and until that changes, each cycle is going to hit us even harder.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Speaking from her experience as chair of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, Borden noted that retail revenues had been down across San Francisco, regardless of lost parking or new development. The presentation noted local retailers’ concerns that the influx of new high-income residents had failed to correlate with increased consumer spending or even more foot traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;One landlord in the audience seemed to contend that the character of San Francisco’s newcomers may ultimately represent a net loss for local retail. “I have these tenants, and they’re all rocket scientists who went to MIT. They don’t know where to find a hardware store. They order everything online, commute to their jobs out of town, and only stay here to drink on weekends.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Arce’s response drew muted laughter: “What cannot be said of them is that they aren’t rocket scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Other local planners and architects insisted that developing the area need not disrupt the “quality of life” in the area if designed accordingly. “There are many neighborhoods in Tokyo that are far more dense than this one, and they’re so calm, I mean—you can hear the birds sing,” one man remarked.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many criticisms were met with the same tentative optimism: “this is why we’re having this conversation,” Arce said until it virtually became his mantra. But the response also drew him back to the night’s most prominent theme: is the status quo the best option?&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Indeed, some attendees immediately shouted “no” when Arce reached a point on his final slide: &lt;em&gt;Does the community still want BART?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Arce confirmed in a brief interview that he would be open to different plans if they proved to be a better option than “if we do nothing.” Other options may come to include a Bus Rapid Transit corridor, or a BART/MUNI transfer station.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Everything and nothing is on the table. Ultimately, everyone in attendance seemed to leave with a satisfied sense of having their input weighted against all options, including nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned 30-year resident, attending for her mobility-impaired neighbor, had bigger plans that night. “I gotta go around the corner and cast my vote for Hillary,” she said to me as we exited the venue.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;(One can only assume she meant Clinton.)&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Scott Wiener took to the popular internet forum Reddit today to answer questions from anonymous users in a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5709cf/hi_reddit_im_san_francisco_supervisor_scott/?st=iu63tdkp&amp;amp;sh=eae38fc6&quot;&gt;“Ask Me Anything”&lt;/a&gt; interviews sponsored by the SF YIMBY Party. (Readers will continue to see advertisements for these interviews on the &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt;, but we will continue to summarize them for readers who may not have the time to follow them live.) Wiener primarily focused on outlining his differences with Supervisor Jane Kim, with whom he is deadlocked in a bitter race for State Senate, but also responded to questions about his relationship with former Congressman Anthony Weiner (there is none).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco’s Proposition V, a sales tax increase on soda distribution, offered a prime opportunity to lash out at Kim’s corporate donors. In response to a question about the soda tax’s exemptions (e.g. milk, beer, diet soda) Wiener declared: “Her campaign is basically being funded by the soda industry - to date, the soda industry has poured neatly a quarter million into mailers promoting her. Her campaign consultant is also the consultant for the soda industry, and he directs where the soda industry money goes.” Citing evidence to back the policy, such as increased diabetes risk and a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-who-soda-tax-20161011-snap-story.html&quot;&gt;WHO recommendation for soda taxes worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, seemed almost an afterthought to his prolonged Kim-bashing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The signature issue in San Francisco politics—and, not incidentally, of this publication as well—took center stage: housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;One Redditor identified as a tech professional and native to Wiener’s supervisorial district asked about the issue in perhaps the most nuanced and even-handed form possible: “What specific policies would you pursue in Sacramento to best balance our recent economic resurgence with the impacts that insane cost of living has had on marginalized communities?” Unlike many inquiries about the housing crisis we’ve seen, this question specifically focused on the given context of the city’s current economic resurgence, and how best to “balance” growth with emergent inequality. Wiener seemed to agree: “the past 5 years have been completely predictable,” the Supervisor noted.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Characteristically, Wiener responded in terms of policies Supervisor Kim had opposed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Jane Kim has repeatedly proposed policies that kill off housing while opposing policies that could spur more housing and more affordable housing. Jane Kim co-authored the Mission Housing Moratorium, while I opposed it. Jane Kim opposed the 7,500 unit Park Merced project (west side housing, with a rail line through it, family sized as well), which I supported. Jane Kim opposed the Affordable Housing Density Bonus program (you get two extra floors in height in exchange for higher percentage of affordable housing), which I supported. And, Jane Kim opposed the Governor's by-right proposal to make it easier to get housing approved. I supported that proposal on the condition that it be amended to, for example, protect rent-controlled housing from demolition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mercifully, not all of Wiener’s policy positions served as platforms for attacking his opponent. The Supervisor answered a question about California’s Cap and Trade policies for carbon emissions and continued GDP growth without once mentioning Kim. “We need to continue to de-carbonize our transportation sector. That means more transit, more no and low-carbon vehicles - with strong and equitable incentives to shift our fleet away from carbon,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Wiener has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/supervisor-scott-wiener-proposes-new-subway-tunnels-throughout-city/&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; extensively on the need to expand BART throughout western San Francisco, which, due to slow MUNI service, remains functionally as remote from San Francisco’s Civic Center as downtown Walnut Creek.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A brief argument ensued over Wiener’s opposition to Proposition 60, the state ballot measure that would require adult film actors to wear condoms on set. The anonymous interrogator, labeled “forever a troll” by another Redditor, harshly criticized Wiener’s preference for standard practices including regular STI testing and PrEP, a drug that prevents HIV transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“At no point have I ever opposed condoms…Condoms helped save our community,” Wiener wrote. “We must continue to make condoms easily available, and I continue to support that. But we should also not pass laws that contradict current public health, scientific approaches to preventing HIV - approaches that, yes, include condoms but also include other prevention techniques, including PrEP” The Supervisor also shrugged off accusations that he had any connection to Gilead, the pharmaceutical conglomerate that manufactures PrEP.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Other issues that did not bring up Jane Kim included maintenance of bike lanes (Answer: “Our city needs a culture change around double parking”) and police accountability (“You can support the police while also supporting reform”).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Marjan Philhour, candidate for District 1 Supervisor, will participate in the next SF YIMBY-sponsored AMA forum on October 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;At noon today, a cavalcade of non-profit developers, tenants, and laborers held a press conference to announce their staunch opposition to San Francisco’s Proposition M… right here at &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; HQ. Proposition M would create two new departments to oversee Housing and Economic Development programs in the city, which critics have decried as needlessly bureaucratic and anti-democratic.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Tim Colen, Executive Director of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition, underscored the importance of the meeting with a simple comment: “only professionals and political gadflies” would have the time to monitor yet another layer of oversight to the already-byzantine process of approving new housing construction in the city. In his estimation, the unelected commission would have the power to make recommendations—even contradictory ones—without any vetting process, which would slow down much-needed housing production. Several other speakers self-identified as “professional gadflies” in qualifying their opposition to Prop M.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Nonprofit developer John Stewart delivered a biting coup-de-grace to the assault on Prop M. The ballot measure, in his view, was designed for a problem that did not exist: lack of community input. “For our Hunters View project, we had over 100 community meetings,” Stewart said. “We are now in the process of developing a project on Broadway. There are six working community groups that we are dealing with, and they all have opinions. We listen to them. Sometimes the feedback is really good, sometimes it’s not, but they’re there. The notion that we need more sunshine, that these deals are going on covertly in the dark, &lt;em&gt;is crazy.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;After covering SFHAC’s “Housing Heroes” award ceremony in &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/sfhac-honors-heroes-with-haughty-hors-doeuvres/&quot;&gt;delicious detail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BAMO&lt;/em&gt; felt that it was only appropriate to give recognition to both sides of the housing conversation. Today, we are proud to present the region’s Top 10 Displays of NIMBYism this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 1) Susan Jaffe Speaks Fondly of the McDonald’s She’s Never Set Foot In&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Watching treasured San Francisco shops and restaurants shutter is never easy, especially if you have a long history in this city. But then there’s, you know, McDonald’s. The fast food location on 3rd and Townsend &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoodline.com/2016/10/3rd-townsend-mcdonald-s-goes-dark-in-preparation-for-demolition&quot;&gt;in the process of being replaced&lt;/a&gt; with much needed high density, transit-proximal housing, which is pretty tough to chalk up as a loss -- unless you are Susan Jaffe. In a shameless Facebook post, Susan laments the change as the destruction of one of her childhood memories. In fact, the golden arches of SoMa were so special to Susan that &lt;em&gt;she literally never even went there&lt;/em&gt;. “I'm a vegetarian,” Susan explains exasperatedly in a Facebook comment. “I don't eat there.” Susan goes on to stick the rhetorical landing, telling her opponent that he doesn’t understand what is sentimental to her. We join Susan’s interlocutor in pleading ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Mission Resident Lucy Admits We Need Affordable Housing But Protests 100% Affordable Housing Complex for Seniors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;1296 Shotwell St. rendering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Last year, Supervisor David Campos asked San Francisco to pass Prop I, which would temporarily ban all new housing in the Mission District unless the units are 100% affordable. An extreme proposal, and it didn’t pass. But apparently even when housing is 100% affordable, and explicitly set aside for an economically vulnerable segment of the population, residents of the Mission and Bernal Heights still find reason to oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A proposal at 1296 Shotwell for 94 units of permanently affordable senior housing failed to meet the standards of its future neighbor, Lucy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/10/neighbors-double-down-against-mission-district-affordable-housing/&quot;&gt;who insisted the project be reduced in size&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that this concession would eliminate affordable units. Lucy acknowledged that “every unit counts”, but with the usual NIMBY caveat that one more affordable housing project “would not solve the problems of the city.” In a rare moment of self-awareness, Lucy declined to provide her last name to &lt;em&gt;Mission Local&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Brisbane Woman Stands up for People Who Fear Becoming a Minority in Their Own Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Fox News somehow missed this story, but we didn’t. The city of Brisbane is considering whether or not to approve a development proposal for offices and housing on its little swath of bay-adjacent land, which would be totally fine with Brisbane except for the part where they have to let people live there. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ci.brisbane.ca.us%2Fspecial-council-meeting-to-discuss-brisbane-baylands-09-29-2016&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEvlPHK_BXpMwSlr3IvDImKJC3UPw&quot;&gt;At a city council meeting in September&lt;/a&gt;, local Brisbanians contemplated the implications of housing, which are basically apocalyptic in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It really doesn’t matter why Brisbane is not going to build housing on the baylands,” this woman tells us, because apparently they don’t believe in reasons in Brisbane.  “Some don’t want to be a minority in their own home - who would?” she says around the 1h17m mark. Who would, indeed, white Brisbane lady?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Millionaire Homeowner in Berkeley Complains about Housing for People That Aren’t Her&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/top-10-bay-area-nimby-moments-of-2016/nimby1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Being a retired Berkeley homeowner is hard. You have to helplessly watch your property value go up all the time, fight the glare of glittering views of the bay, and constantly toil through the philosophical conundrum of whether or not Philz Coffee is a chain. How does one manage? Well, one way to ease the stress is going to city planning hearings and eulogizing your first-world problems to anyone who is paid to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This woman, who owns a house worth over a million dollars but pays property taxes based on an assessed value of about 20% of that amount, spoke at a Berkeley City Council meeting this past July against three new homes, which she said would &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hanlonbt/status/784140878541496320&quot;&gt;“set a dangerous precedent” in the neighborhood.&lt;/a&gt; Sharing is scaring, right?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Peter Cohen, Director of an Affordable Housing Organization, Opposes Affordable Housing Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In one of the most head-scratching policy oppositions in San Francisco this year, a measure put forward to increase the amount of affordable housing through a density bonus program ended up getting challenged by members of the affordable housing community itself. Yes, we were also shocked. The proposal would allow developers to add three stories to a building irrespective of zoned height limits, but under the condition that all the extra units are affordable. More density, more affordability, and at no cost to taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sounds like an awesome deal (it is), but Peter Cohen, Director of the affordable housing nonprofit Council of Community Housing Organizations (CCHO), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-housing-density-plan-meets-opposition-6810769.php&quot;&gt;came out as one of the loudest opponents of the bill&lt;/a&gt;. Cohen said it was too much of a giveaway to private developers, which seems to completely miss the fact that it is actually a giveaway to middle-income families. We admit this one doesn’t technically qualify as NIMBYism in the literal sense, but Mr. Cohen doesn’t technically qualify as an affordable housing advocate, either.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Man Who Can Walk to Fremont BART Explains How Important Cars Are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Hugh Vassar, who would like you to know that he has purchased not one but two single-family homes in Fremont, doesn’t think building housing near BART will reduce people’s use of cars. How does Hugh know that? Because he lives right next to BART, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fremontca.viebit.com/#K7J3x1kL3QTQ&quot;&gt;and he drives all the time&lt;/a&gt;! Even as a frequent BART commuter, Hugh “never got rid of any cars” (is he a collector?), which means the future residents of the proposed BART-adjacent housing development he opposes won’t either. We would explain to Hugh that increasing density and walkability doesn’t happen overnight, and the development is a really good start, but he is already speeding away from us.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Environmental Attorney Stu Flashman Fights Green, Eco-friendly CalTrain Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Stu Flashman, who is not a character in a Marvel comic but a real-life land use and environmental attorney, represented Atherton in its fight against CalTrain’s electrification plan, a plan the Sierra Club called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/sce/loma-prieta-chapter/cool-cities-action/12.13.12%20-%20Article%20-%20Caltrain%20electrification%20project%20lauded%20by%20Sierra%20Club.pdf&quot;&gt;one of the best transportation projects of the year&lt;/a&gt; back in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The plan in question is to replace CalTrain’s diesel engine trains with electrified trains, in order to increase operating efficiency, accommodate more riders, and significantly reduce air pollution. Stu argued that the environmental review didn’t take into account the cumulative effects of an electrified CalTrain and the high speed rail, since apparently twice as much mass transit probably means twice as much pollution. Except electrifying CalTrain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caltrain.com/Assets/Caltrain+Modernization+Program/Documents/PCEP+Fact+Sheet+May+2015.pdf&quot;&gt;has enormous environmental benefits&lt;/a&gt;: taking cars off the road with 619,000 less vehicle miles traveled and reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 176,000 metric tons of CO2.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Stu Flashman and Atherton &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.almanacnews.com/news/2016/09/28/atherton-loses-lawsuit-over-caltrain-electrification-project&quot;&gt;ultimately lost the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, but they didn’t lose a place on this list.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) Berkeley Resident Kelly Hammargren Confuses NIMBYism with Valid Legal Argument&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kelly Hammargren has spent more than two years fighting a proposed housing project at 2211 Harold Way, including a legal battle which might have made more headway by now if Hammargren actually had a lawyer. The project she’s opposing, a 300-plus unit building next to a BART station, has been in the works since December 2012. Although more than 30 community meetings having been held since the project’s application, Hammargren eventually decided to step it up to the big leagues by going to court.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for her, a judge is supposed to consider legal arguments, and it seems Hammargren didn’t really have any. At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/08/29/court-considers-challenge-to-berkeleys-2211-harold-way-project/&quot;&gt;a hearing in August&lt;/a&gt;, the judge had to ask Hammargren to stick to legal arguments and not make political speeches, ultimately denying her motion. Without any mention of her lawsuit, Hammargren has exhorted Berkeley students to support her flagrant NIMBYism because, you know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailycal.org/2016/09/16/harold-way-project-mired-problems/&quot;&gt;historic views&lt;/a&gt; or something.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9) Spike Kahn Doesn’t Want Any New Properties in the Mission Unless She Owns Them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Beast&quot; on Bryant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Mission housing proposal dubbed the “Beast on Bryant” by opponents is more of a building than a Disney villain, but when you’re a NIMBY, nouns are relative and the dictionary is a capitalist manifesto. In any semantic case, Spike Kahn has been leading the charge against the housing proposal on 2000-2070 Bryant, a 300-plus unit building with a portion of affordable units. It’s such an inoffensive project that &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.curbed.com/2016/9/15/12931964/beast-on-bryant-loses-appeals-lawsuit&quot;&gt;even David Campos supports it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But here’s where things get prickly for Spike. While Spike Kahn has spoken passionately against this housing project “destroying the neighborhood” because of all its moneyed implications, or something, she conveniently leaves out the fact that she owns rental properties and is totally killing it in on AirBnB. Yeah, the beast-slayer owns &lt;a href=&quot;http://datagovus.com/san-francisco-business.php?id=1027901-05-151&quot;&gt;numerous properties&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco and regularly AirBnBs her home. Take a look at her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/30614&quot;&gt;user profile&lt;/a&gt;, and go ahead and ask her for a discount on your nightly price too, since affordability is so important to Spike.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) Jean Quan's Activist Daughter Sticks it to Developers by Demanding More Parking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Fighting for the little guy is important, especially when the little guy is a car. Just ask Lailan Huen, daughter of former Oakland mayor Jean Quan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/05/oakland-housing-wood-partners-gentrification-quan.html&quot;&gt;who is leading the call for parking-related concessions from Wood Partners on one of its development proposals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The project at issue is a 262-unit residential proposal that will, ironically, replace an existing parking lot located walking distance from several BART stations. In addition to calling for increased affordability percentages, which will likely require millions of dollars in subsidies, Huen and her followers want 25 parking spaces or a $50,000 payment to fund parking. Hint: the housing might be more affordable if it didn’t require so much parking.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to our Top 10 NIMBYs! You earned it—at everyone else’s expense.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The vice presidential debate on Tuesday, October 4 took place in Farmville, VA, where a  16 year old led once a historic student strike..&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Barbara Rose Johns Powell was born in New York City in 1935, according to the Moton Museum’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motonmuseum.org/biography-barbara-rose-johns-powell/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. She lived during the time of Jim Crow and her school in Prince Edward County lacked many resources, including science laboratories.. When Johns confronted her teacher about this, her teacher indifferently dismissed the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Johns became determined to organize a strike. She planned to “make signs and ... give a speech stating [their] dissatisfaction and ... march out [of] the school.” Johns’s strike caught the attention of two NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) lawyers and was later filed in a federal courthouse. This case was influential in the Brown v Board of Education of Topeka, which proclaimed the “separate but equal” law unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As a 16 year old, Barbara Rose Johns influenced one of the biggest cases in America that pushed our nation towards inclusiveness and equality.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Her legacy lives on in the Yes on F campaign today. Meanwhile, one prominent argument against Prop F is that teens will just vote the same way as their parents. The statistical rebuttal is that 44% of teens voted a different way as their parents in the Scottish independence referendum. The logical reasoning is that influence isn’t a one-way street; it goes both ways. Teens impact their parents as much as their parents shape their lives, and teens are capable of thinking independently (why else would there be so many stereotypes of the “rebellious teen?”).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As part of the Youth Empowerment Academy , we celebrate Barbara Rose Johns and want to build on her legacy of empowering youth.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When I presented in front of the New Avenues Democratic Club, Hene Kelly, a former DCCC member and Democratic Party activist, noted how youth, in one night, were able to change 5 Supervisors’ minds to put Vote16 on the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Club members also mentioned how seeing young people excited made them excited again as well. Our contagious passion for civic engagement is spreading faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The American Beverage Association is not happy about Proposition V, San Francisco’s proposed tax on sugary sodas. Campaigns on both sides of the bay are portraying soda taxes as a “grocery tax,” because the proposed legislation would levy a sales tax increase on distributors rather than consumer-facing transactions. Technically, a retailer could disburse the increased cost across all merchandise in the store.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Campaign finance disclosures show that the No On V committee, sponsored by the American Beverage Association California PAC, has spent $10 million to garner public opposition against the measure. No On V has also paid for several organizations’ slate cards to be mailed to voters citywide, including $40,000 donated to the San Francisco Tenants Union, and $5,000 to the Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Oddly, although the Tenants Union mailer endorses Tenants Together director Dean Preston for District 5 Supervisor and urges voters to reject the soda tax, Preston himself expressed support for the tax in a District 5 &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/TranscriptViewer.php?view_id=74&amp;amp;clip_id=26261&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the League of Women Voters.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Preston joined the Tenants Union, along with homeowners’ groups such as the Haight-Ashbury Neighborhood Council and Telegraph Hill Dwellers, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoodline.com/2016/01/activists-fear-rezoning-plan-will-reduce-rent-controlled-housing-despite-assurances&quot;&gt;opposing&lt;/a&gt; last year’s Affordable Housing Bonus Program. Opponents claimed that the density bonuses the bill would provide for more affordable housing units could allow for the demolition of rent-controlled apartments, even after the Board of Supervisors amended the proposal to avoid such situations. Preston &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoodline.com/2016/01/activists-fear-rezoning-plan-will-reduce-rent-controlled-housing-despite-assurances&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; neighbors as being “alarmed” that a rezoning on Divisadero allowed a project to scale up from 16 to 60 dwelling units.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Last year, Preston also spearheaded a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/999050313480342/&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; to halt the construction of several condominium projects on Divisadero Street, arguing that market-rate housing “will be completely unaffordable to our neighborhood.” Given these claims, it may be worth noting what is in fact affordable for Preston himself.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Preston purchased his current home across from Alamo Square in 1999 for $880,000 in cash. Though its current estimated value is $2.8 million, its assessed value for tax purposes is $1.1 million due to statewide caps on property taxes enacted under 1979’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3497&quot;&gt;Proposition 13&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TenantsUnionSF/status/735249477565452288&quot;&gt;unclear&lt;/a&gt; whether or not the Tenants Union considers California’s tax structure to be a relevant factor in statewide economic inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The open secret of Big Soda money funding countless campaigns throughout the city, including campaigns that support the soda tax measure, will be an ongoing story.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Homeowners opposing nearby development is nothing new—it’s why this news source exists, after all. Remarkably, some homeowners appear to have colluded with Lafayette city officials to oppose new housing construction, possibly on taxpayers’ dime. According to an investigation of public records conducted by this paper, residents assisting in organizing against the Saranap Village project include City Manager Steve Falk, Planning and Building Director Niroop Srivatsa and Parks, Trails and Recreation Director Jennifer Russell.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Situated in an unincorporated area between Lafayette and Walnut Creek, the developer Hall Equities Group has already downsized the project’s residential portion by 22% and halved its retail component. The three city officials in the investigation all live within a mile of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Planning Director Srivatsa said via email to a Bay Area News Group reporter, “I would prefer not to be referred to as Lafayette’s planning director” when speaking about the project. Earlier press shows Srivatsa speaking against the project as a member of the Saranap Homeowners Association. Emails also show City Manager Falk and Parks Director Russell encouraging residents to circulate a petition on the neighborhood social media platform Nextdoor. City staff unsuccessfully lobbied the Walnut Creek City Council to comment on the project’s environmental review process.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; developed an interest in the potential misuse of city resources after we began wondering how the Saranap Homeowners’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saranap.org/sv/project-background.html#fnd&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; could include such detailed renditions of the project, which they deem “too tall” for the surrounding area, unless professional urban planning software had been used.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already reduced the proposal from the original 235 units, eventually down to 160,” said Deborah Karbo, Vice President of Hall Equities Group. “It’s likely we’re not done yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;City officials could be found to be in violation of California Government Code &lt;a href=&quot;http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-8314.html&quot;&gt;section 8314&lt;/a&gt;, which reads in part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The East Bay suburb of San Leandro may see a revitalized marina as early as next year, as a multiphase mixed-use project by Cal-Coast Development nears the end of its preliminary planning stage. Monarch Bay’s 40 acres of apartments, retail, office space, and amenities has been approved by the San Leandro City Council, and will soon be reviewed by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC). As of 2011, the state agency requires new construction to plan for withstanding rising sea levels due to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Cal-Coast’s most immediate plans include 150,000 square feet of office space, a 468-space parking garage, two restaurants, and a kayak rental facility. A residential component would not be included until the second phase, with several four-story buildings providing 160 rental units and 61 condominiums. An average of 1.5 parking spaces per residential unit is planned, with at least 587 additional public parking spaces planned for the shoreline. San Leandro &lt;a href=&quot;https://sanleandro.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2285006&amp;amp;GUID=B3C57382-78E9-4041-98FB-AE0CB9011EE8&amp;amp;Options=&amp;amp;Search=&quot;&gt;amended&lt;/a&gt; its general plan for the area last year to accommodate the project’s mixed-use components in its zoning code.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Resistance to the project has coalesced behind a lawsuit filed by the Coalition for the San Leandro Shoreline against the city and the developer. The coalition is led by the neighboring Marina Inn. Opponents cited fears of displacing local residents and losing views of the Bay when speaking to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/09/29/san-leandro-shoreline-project-could-break-ground-next-year/&quot;&gt;East Bay Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ed Miller, a representative for Cal-Coast Development, said he had personally never been involved in a project with such a long process, totaling over 8 years and 78 public hearings, with a local citizens’ committee providing community input. City Council had approved a similar plan &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/2012/04/03/san-leandro-approves-plan-to-move-toward-marina-development/&quot;&gt;four years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It’s a frivolous lawsuit under CEQA, but it has no validity under CEQA,” Miller said regarding the lawsuit. “They’re using criteria like view corridors, which are not covered [under the California Environmental Quality Act].”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Miller alleged that the lawsuit was economically motivated, rather than out of any concern for environmental impacts. He based this claim on the fact that The Marina Inn has 18 years left on its lease, but is required to have at least 35 years to apply for refinancing in order to remodel or sell the property. “Our project would be providing a completely different hotel class,” Miller added, suggesting that potential hoteliers such as Hyatt would not create competition for The Marina Inn.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Regarding the proposed office space, Miller said Cal-Coast would not be leasing offices until they found a tenant, but the developer is currently “in talks with a potential big tenant.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Representatives for the Marina Inn could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Opponents of several San Francisco ballot measures have coalesced to portray the referendum legislation as “&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;umb, &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;armful, and &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt;ots of &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;oney.” Widely viewed as an effort by the Board of Supervisors’ “progressive” faction to dilute the power of Mayor Ed Lee, a group representing small businesses held a press conference in The Castro today to voice their disapproval of Proposition M in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Proposition M proposes a charter amendment to create a new independent Commission of Housing and Development to have full oversight of the newly created Department of Economic and Workforce Development and Department of Housing and Community Development. Their functions are currently under the Mayor’s Office of Housing (MOH) and Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD), which would cease to exist if Proposition M passes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Local urban planning think-tank SPUR &lt;a href=&quot;https://spurvoterguide.org/sf-nov-16/prop-m-housing-and-development-commision/&quot;&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; Propositions D, H, L, and M as “piecemeal moves to chip away at the definition of roles, in particular to weaken the office of the mayor,” a persistent pattern since San Francisco’s adoption of a new city charter in 1995. SPUR’s voter guide primarily focuses on the proposed commission’s unchecked power to make recommendations on development agreements to the Board of Supervisors, especially with surplus land transfers. But these objections were hardly mentioned at today’s press conference.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Reporters gathered at Local Take, a small shop for locally sourced arts &amp;amp; crafts, were greeted by rousing speeches from Steve Adams, Vice President of the Castro Merchants Association, and Henry Karnilowicz, president of the Council of District Merchants. Speakers focused on the harm to small businesses an additional layer of oversight would create. The commission’s stated mandate of regulating housing production was hardly even mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“As anyone who lives near a commercial corridor knows, small businesses form the backbone of a community,” Adams said. He went on to praise the local flavor of commercial districts as far apart as Visitacion Valley, Noe Valley, and Taraval in the Sunset District.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“OEWD helps young people achieve their dreams,” said Derek Tam, representing the Chinatown Merchants Association. “I came here as an immigrant from Hong Kong. This is my first time running a business. The OEWD helped me with every step of the process, from raising capital to permitting.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Tony Winnicker, a former aide to Mayor Lee, stood in front of the group of speakers, taking pictures of the business owners posing with “No on M” signs. Winnicker &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Mayor-s-adviser-will-work-to-defeat-4-ballot-9211454.php&quot;&gt;abruptly left&lt;/a&gt; the mayor’s office on an unpaid leave of absence to lead the joint campaign against D, H, L, and M.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“This measure would create an additional layer of oversight over housing and small business growth, with no accountability to the voters,” Winnicker said. “The mayor gets three appointments, the Board of Supervisors appoints three, and the Controller appoints one. So we would have an independent commission, with no requirement that anyone have any experience with economic development. It’s ludicrious to claim that this would help create more housing in the midst of our crisis-level shortage.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;What, in his view, were the perceived justifications for Prop M?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The people behind this measure don’t want more affordable housing,” Winnicker insisted, “they want to slow down growth. They want the city to remain frozen.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I pressed Winnicker on the issue of small businesses. If so many local business owners had come out to oppose Prop M and defend the Office of Economic Development, was the Prop M campaign attempting any sort of rebuttal? “No, they haven’t even tried to claim that it will help small businesses,” he said. “It’s almost like they just saw the word ‘development’ and thought, ‘that sounds good, let’s throw that in there’—because for many, &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; has a negative connotation, and they’re eager to slow it down.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a fan of Nancy Skinner ever since I saw her speak in a debate in support the idea of raising gas taxes. In a region crippled by underfunded transit services, it’s easy to overlook that highways are in fact our best-funded form of “public transit,” particularly when taxes on gasoline have remained &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/11871/inflation-not-bike-sharing-is-why-the-gas-tax-isnt-enough/&quot;&gt;below inflation&lt;/a&gt; for decades, but Skinner gets it. Her opponent for State Senate in District 9, Sandre Swanson, seemed to take a stance against them purely out of a blanket opposition to regressive taxation.
California, as many Californians know, is a complete mess when it comes to money.
Rather than approaching Skinner under the disingenuous guise of “objective” journalism, I decided to embrace my position as a fan-boy (I voted for Skinner in the primary election) and get to deeper questions about what California &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, and what we can become.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Even if she weren’t &lt;a href=&quot;http://skinner4senate.com/&quot;&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; for office, Skinner’s resume is storied enough for a hardcover book. During her time on the State Assembly, she penned successful bills to &lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100AB999&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/a&gt; juvenile incarceration sentences, &lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100AB560&quot;&gt;incentivize&lt;/a&gt; the use of solar energy, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB48&quot;&gt;strengthen&lt;/a&gt; the ban on assault weapons. In the 1980s, Skinner sat on Berkeley’s City Council as the first student to have won elected office in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; interviewed Skinner by phone, we elected to focus on her broader experience and long-ranging perspectives on California politics, rather than particular aspects of her current campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been shortened and edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SFBAMO: Hi Nancy, thanks for taking the time to speak with us. Since you’re aiming to return to the State Legislature, I’d like to open by discussing some of Governor Brown’s recent proposals. First there was his “by-right” permit streamlining that failed to garner bipartisan support, but then more recently, Brown &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/In-S-F-talk-Brown-says-he-won-t-refight-Prop-6555024.php&quot;&gt;mentioned in a talk&lt;/a&gt; that he wasn’t willing to put up the fight to reform Prop 13 and CEQA.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skinner:&lt;/em&gt; You’re kidding. What did he say?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something along the lines of, “Reforming CEQA is the Lord’s work, but the Lord’s work doesn’t always get done.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Well that’s a real shame. In these last few years of his term, &lt;em&gt;we need him&lt;/em&gt;. Politically, he has nothing to lose, and it came about during his first governorship.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So aside from that, there’s his by-right proposal from earlier this summer. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/08/unions-against-gov-browns-as-of-right-housing-plan.html&quot;&gt;A lot has been written&lt;/a&gt; about how CEQA negotiation was a main obstacle to getting labor unions to support it. What can be done to get any sort of reform through this thick web of alliances we have in place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Permit streamlining is one way, but it’s not the only way. We need to have serious talks about zoning and what its purpose was. Now that we’re talking about Black Lives Matter, how our criminal justice policies, sentencing, and incarceration rates have so damaged the black community—many [zoning policies] were designed for exactly that purpose. It goes back to the neighborhoods that used to have covenants that prevented Jews, Hispanics, Asians, African-Americans from being able to purchase property. At the same time you had redlining which the federal government backed, which prevented many of those groups from even getting a loan. We already know that much of our housing policies had racist intent.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Through the Fair Housing Act, we’ve begun to try to change that, but I think now we have to look at the whole notion of single-family zoning. If we dedicate large amounts of land to single-family zoning, when we have a housing shortage and crisis, we are explicitly assuring that the highest-cost housing is going to be there. If we look at the data around income and wealth, it will primarily benefit more high-income people, and the majority of high-income people in our country tend to be white.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;So we have to re-look at all of these policies through what their purpose was, and also, what do we want from a neighborhood? I think what we want from a neighborhood is: the ability to work and shop and get our childcare and education, and everything else we need, in close proximity. Some level of single-family zoning helps prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned in your interview with the &lt;em&gt;East Bay Express&lt;/em&gt; that Berkeley reformed its council elections after you helped spread some affordable housing around the city. Could you tell us a little more about that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Berkeley’s district elections came about because the city council back in ’85—when I sat on it—was incredibly fortunate to be awarded some HUD money for permanently affordable scattered-site housing. We were very happy about it because it would be housing that would not be concentrated in one site, and could spread equity throughout the city. We fully embraced it. Then we started holding public hearings.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Each of the sites had no more than around 8 units. We were mostly picking sites we already had access to, whether city parcels or school district parcels.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In the course of the public hearings, some clever folks saw the opportunity to grab back power, started meeting with neighbors, and proposed district elections. The neighbors who opposed the housing jumped right on it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The way district lines were drawn, those of us who were seated members of the council, three of the districts forced two incumbents to run against each other. They literally drew the district line at my house—now, I didn’t own the house, I was a renter—at Grant and Virginia. Grant is a small street, and they could have drawn it at Martin Luther King Way, but no, they drew it at Grant. It just shows the depth of what some people will do to stop development of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berkeley provides a pretty interesting case study of that dynamic. As I understand it, what we now know as the “progressive” coalition in town formed out of urgent pressure for rent control and tenant protections in the early ‘70s. While that remains true to this day, some outside observers have difficulty understanding how this grew to include anti-development stances, paradoxically, as a way to preserve rent controlled housing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Well, back in 1973, there was an initiative in Berkeley called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=djSlK1tuwjkC&amp;amp;pg=PA152&amp;amp;lpg=PA152&amp;amp;dq=berkeley+neighborhood+preservation+ordinance&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=17_EG48w9L&amp;amp;sig=O5_MzgzuVUoWERDJ15r_J-Gtsjk&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwvZO9lcLPAhUO-GMKHannAkUQ6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=berkeley%20neighborhood%20preservation%20ordinance&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Neighborhood Preservation Ordinance&lt;/a&gt; (NPO). Before that, Berkeley had few restrictions on tearing down property. With the campus expanding and housing pressures growing, as well as BART opening, all of a sudden you had people buying up houses in South Berkeley, knocking them down, and putting in what some people considered ugly units, stucco apartments. There needed to be some design review standards, demolition control, some process, but the NPO, in hindsight, went really far. It wasn’t that there were big developers looking to build in Berkeley, but a lot of smaller owners.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At the time there was a wing of the Democratic Party on the council that was pro-Vietnam War, didn’t mind houses being torn down, opposed rent control—it created what in hindsight looks like a funny alliance. You had tenant activists, student activists, anti-war activists, neighborhood preservationists, Grey Panthers, all coalesced together. First they formed an organization called the April Coalition, which became Berkeley Citizens’ Action. Over time, BCA was not so opposed to development—they were opposed to big developers, suspicious of the profit motive, but they still acknowledged the need for new housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As there started to be interest by developers to invest in urban areas, and interest by the city to allow it, now you have these coalitions where some progressives say “there’s too much construction in Berkeley, developers are going wild,” while other people like myself say “no, we need units, we have great transit…we need to build more housing! If we don’t, no one’s going to be able to live here.” That is something that many progressives feel very strongly about. I think it’s a false dichotomy for some to claim that more housing is anti-progressive.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In contrast, there was a legitimate objection to development on Berkeley’s waterfront, on what is now Eastshore State Park. Not only does it have a liquefaction zone, but everyone deserves access to the gorgeous waterfront. This is where these things get tricky. There were progressives all throughout the town totally opposed to development there, but somewhere along the way, that nuance of good development and bad development got lost.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s take up the different but related topic of transportation. You developed quite a record on the assembly of pushing for renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy. How do you see yourself extending that towards transportation, which as we now know is the biggest source of Greenhouse Gas Emissions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I used to create methodologies for counting carbon with &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.iclei.org/index.php?id=10829&quot;&gt;Cities for Climate Protection&lt;/a&gt; [which Skinner founded in 1993], and we’ve known since we did California’s first state inventory, that the electric sector before we adopted renewable portfolio standards, was pretty low-carbon compared to other states. It’s still worth it to get carbon entirely out of the energy sector, but we knew since the early ‘90s that the majority of our carbon emissions come from transportation. It’s just a harder sector to get at, because in the energy sector, you’ve got a few actors; in transportation, you have millions of residents making transportation decisions every day.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I’ve always supported a carbon tax. Cap and trade is a little bit less efficient than a straight carbon tax, and I’m actually a fan of a carbon tax rebate. It helps address the inequities that cap and trade doesn’t. If we can design a revenue measure that gives us the ability to improve infrastructure, that could also be a price on fuel that could discourage the use of fossil fuels, then that’s a good thing. So far, the legislature has not been able to get the vote.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that mostly has to do with the critics saying a gas tax would be regressive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;There’s ways to design a tax so it’s less regressive. For example, sales taxes as currently implemented are pretty regressive, whereas the income tax on the ballot in Prop 55 is progressive.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This brings us to the broader issue of California’s fiscal problems. On the one hand, we have Proposition 13 limiting how much property tax gets collected, while on the other, Proposition 98 mandates a threshold for education funding. Is the problem, then, that generally Californians will commit to pay for progressive causes, but not agree to pay for it themselves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Right. We have to choose between funding our schools and funding affordable housing? That’s not a legitimate choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you support Senator Loni Hancock’s proposal to reform Prop 13 with a split roll?&lt;/strong&gt; [Skinner is running to replace Hancock in SD09. &lt;em&gt;-Eds.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. I’ve voted on it in the past. We had it before us in committee and it passed, but never got to the floor. I think we’re at the point where Californians are beginning to accept that there are some flaws in Prop 13.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In 2008, we had the provision from Prop 13 that California’s budget be approved by a two-thirds vote. As we got more and more Democrats, Republicans would negotiate by holding up the budget. During the recession, voters finally approved a majority vote budget.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since you mentioned the Black Lives Matter movement, I wanted to wrap up with a question about that. The &lt;em&gt;East Bay Express&lt;/em&gt; was quick to bring up your numerous endorsements from police unions. How would you reassure someone suspicious of that?—since, you know, regardless of your other policy stances, one could certainly jump to conclusions…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;My record in the Assembly, and prior to that, was often opposed by police chiefs. Believe it or not, the bill I carried to require that all rape kit evidence was tested and put into databases, was opposed by police chiefs. The bill that would have adjusted the way that investigations of police misconduct worked, making some parts of the process publicly transparent, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; large entities opposed that—but I voted yes. I think my history shows that I will be a strong partner with all our law enforcement agencies to improve public safety and put justice back in the criminal justice system.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be a partner with law enforcement in ways that are discriminatory, or lessen public safety. The last thing I’d say is that the misconduct we are seeing in videos constantly in a number of our police departments, and [the Celeste Guap scandal] with the young woman from Richmond, is so awful. I strongly support DA Nancy O’Malley’s efforts to prosecute the officers involved. But it’s a handful. Even if you look at officers that draw a gun, again, it’s a handful. I want those officers weeded out, I want them prosecuted, but we can’t take those examples and say all law enforcement is that.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well that’s about all I had prepared for now. Thanks again and good luck at the ballot box!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Thank you, take care.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco voters have received their ballot handbooks in the mail, and many have noticed that it’s awfully big and heavy. One reason is that there are record &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beyondchron.org/sf-politics-skips-summer-break/&quot;&gt;25 local measures&lt;/a&gt; on the ballot, along with another 17 state measures and sundry races for public office. Adding to this are the various citizen- and committee-submitted ballot arguments for and against measures. In the case of local measures, there are both officially chosen representative arguments, plus a plethora of paid arguments.  It looks like there will be at least a small kerfuffle over one of those arguments, if correspondence we received from the San Francisco Libertarian Party is any indication.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The City’s Libertarians are opposing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD387f98HPAhVLyWMKHYYsAnYQFggcMAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvoterguide.sfelections.org%2Fen%2Fcity-college-parcel-tax&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH3IvynHlVVZ_5HykIN18v0jDzbFg&amp;amp;sig2=AB8Zq-cRyYDF7LofwZ17jA&amp;amp;bvm=bv.134495766,d.cGc&quot;&gt;Prop B&lt;/a&gt;, the extension of the parcel tax for City College. We may not necessarily agree with their principles, but certainly they’re entitled to express their opinion via the ballot handbook, either by submitting an entry for the randomly selected official argument, or a paid argument. Apparently, they were blocked from doing either, due to the action (or inaction) of Supervisor Aaron Peskin.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;According to the email the &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; received from Aubrey Freeman, SFLP chair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In a recent meeting of ours, one of our members offered to write an opposing argument to Prop B for submission to the DOE (Department of Elections) for the “free” lottery on August 18.  About a week prior to the deadline, we called the DOE for clarification on the pre-empting process, whereby members of the Board of Supervisors get first dibs at being the official opponents of ballot measures… Much to our surprise, we noted that Supervisor Aaron Peskin had pre-empted the opposing argument to Prop B… we decided not to submit our member’s solid argument (listed above) on August 18, and we would decide after the lottery what to submit as paid arguments the following Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;To our utter shock, when the DOE ran the lottery (and it really is random—they literally put crumpled pieces of paper in a jar), John Arntz, the Director of the DOE, announced that that no argument was submitted against Prop B and moved on to the next one.  What happened to Peskin’s opposing argument?  We checked with the DOE the next day, and they confirmed that Peskin was the official opponent but had in fact submitted nothing…&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;… There was no question about submitting the above argument as a paid argument… Three days later we received a call from the DOE.  In reviewing all the documents received for the paid arguments, they discovered that Prop B is actually a “district” measure, not a regular ballot measure, and as such no paid argument can be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It gets worse. As it turns out, according to the DOE, because Prop B is considered to outside the scope of City government (the Community College District answers to the State), not only are there no paid arguments, but also Peskin, being a City official, was never entitled to submit an argument pre-empting any others in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly possible that this was just a bureaucratic snafu. The problem is that Peskin’s associates have a history of playing tricks with the ballot handbook. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.planetizen.com/node/67821&quot;&gt;Back in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, one of Peskin’s ward heelers, Jon Gollinger, created a similar stir with ballot arguments against a measure that he sponsored in the June 2013 election – which, ironically was also designated Proposition B. The Board of Supervisors later passed an ordinance to prevent that sort of thing from happening again, but apparently, that doesn’t apply to State District measures.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;After the end of prohibition, the state of California restricted the number of liquor licenses it granted to one per 2,000 residents in a county. Many San Francisco licenses have been grandfathered in since that time, with over 1,000 licenses far exceeding the 418 allowed by law. Local businesses trade existing licenses in a steeply inflated secondary market. State Senator Mark Leno negotiated the issuance of five new liquor licenses to San Francisco County in &lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1285&quot;&gt;SB-1285&lt;/a&gt;, a bill signed by Governor Jerry Brown last week.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The new licenses will be targeted toward outer commercial districts where restaurants may not be able to afford $300,000 for a license—instead, startup costs will require a much lower $13,800 application fee for a non-transferable license. Eligibility is directed at commercial corridors in the Excelsior, Visitacion Valley, Bayview, and the Sunset, rather than already-booming districts such as Hayes Valley or the Mission.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The new licenses are intended to increase business opportunities in neighborhoods that have seen relatively little growth amid the city’s vast employment gains. Ben Van Houten, Business Development Manager for nightlife at the Office of Economic and Workforce Development, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2016/09/30/sf-new-liquor-licenses-jerry-brown-abc-restaurants.html?ana=RSS%26s=article_search&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Business Times&lt;/em&gt;: “there are corridors without a single restaurant with a full liquor license, and others with only a few, when you have tens of thousands of residents.” His office initially asked for 28 new licenses, and plans to continue lobbying the State Legislature for more.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Should the number of applicants exceed the five new licenses available, the licenses will be issued in a lottery system. San Francisco will issue its first new liquor licenses in 77 years in September 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Nearly two years since Atherton sued the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board over the Caltrain electrification project, a ruling has come in favor of the project, validating the environmental impact report that was at issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Peninsula Corridor Electrification Project (PCEP) is part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caltrain.com/projectsplans/CaltrainModernization/Modernization/PeninsulaCorridorElectrificationProject.html&quot;&gt;Caltrain’s Modernization Program&lt;/a&gt;. The plan is designed to improve Caltrain system performance, reduce noise, improve air quality, and is expected to accommodate increased system ridership through its improved service operations. An electrified Caltrain is scheduled to be operational by late 2020 or early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Atherton’s basis for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.almanacnews.com/media/reports/1423535501.pdf&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; was inadequate completion of the Environmental Impact Report, specifically claiming that it failed to address the cumulative impact of both the electrification project and the high speed rail project also slated to run through the corridor. In its complaint, Atherton disputed the “standalone” nature of the electrification project, citing proposed Caltrain compatibility with the high speed rail, as well as shared funding, as indicative of a blended system that would require additional environmental study.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Judge Barry P. Goode of Contra Costa County Superior Court ultimately rejected this claim. Siding with Caltrain, he stated the two projects were independent of one another, and that even if the High Speed Rail Project “never take[s] a step forward”, the electrification project could still be implemented successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Stuart Flashman, a land use and environmental attorney who represented Atherton in the suit, has battled many infrastructure projects in the Bay Area. Earlier this year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/04/06/cupertino-city-council-groups-initiative-could-raise-neighborhood-building-height-limits-to-45-feet/&quot;&gt;Flashman fought a ballot initiative&lt;/a&gt; in Cupertino that asked voters to approve a new housing and commerical development, effectively raising height limits from 30 feet to 45 feet. Flashman also sits on the Rockridge Community Planning Council (RCPC), and has frequently voiced traffic and parking concerns in response to several projects in the Rockridge neighborhood, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/shall-we-shop-at-safeway-or-safeway/Content?oid=2967148&quot;&gt;renovated Safeway&lt;/a&gt; on College Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Flashman also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westsideobserver.com/news/rogers.html&quot;&gt;represented litigants&lt;/a&gt; in an unsuccessful appeal to prevent housing construction in San Francisco's Parkmerced neighborhood (nearly 9,000 units in total, of which up to 3,200 units would be rent-controlled).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Adina Levin, the Project Director at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greencaltrain.com/about/&quot;&gt;Friends of Caltrain&lt;/a&gt;, was thrilled with the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Caltrain electrification is a popular, highly beneficial, essential, and long-awaited project. It will help more people use sustainable transportation and relieve congestion, and it is critical to Peninsula corridor cities ongoing transit-oriented development,” she told the &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt;. Levin described the lawsuit as “a vain attempt to defend against high speed rail by crippling our region's transportation and land use goals is baffling...We are glad to see this lawsuit dismissed so definitively.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Besides easing traffic congestion, there are numerous environmental benefits cited for the project. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caltrain.com/about/MediaRelations/news/Caltrain_s_Board_Approves_Electrification_Design-Build_and_EMU_Contracts.html&quot;&gt;Caltrain’s website&lt;/a&gt;, an electrified system will improve regional air quality by up to 97% and reduce greenhouse gas emission by 176,000 metric tons of CO2, taking more than 619,000 daily vehicle miles off the region’s roadways by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Yes on F’s media coverage right now consists of this column and the SF Chronicle’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Voting-should-remain-a-privilege-for-adult-9206099.php&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;After reaching out to major and local newspaper outlets, Yes on F’s media team received no response from most. KQED’s Matthew Green emailed Celi Tamayo-Lee, Generation Citizen’s Youth Empowerment Academy coordinator, requesting to make a Yes on F film and to interview two students. Green manages the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/&quot;&gt;Lowdown&lt;/a&gt;, a news education site that covers politics aimed at students.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Green and Dayton planned to film our Sept. 8 meeting and Sept. 18 canvassing event. Fallout Pictures’ Todd Dayton served as the videographer, and the video is scheduled to come out mid-October.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Oliver York, a 17-year-old Lick-Wilmerding senior who has helped in organizing the campaign, was chosen to do an interview. On the basis of being an aspiring journalist, I was asked to fulfill the second interview.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;York and I were interviewed in the hallway of the WeWork building, where Generation Citizen has a conference room for Yes on F.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The interview started with typical questions, such as “Tell me about yourself” and “Why are you part of this campaign?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;More specific questions followed, including “What would you vote for if you could vote,” and, “If Prop F passes, do you think a lot of 16 and 17 year olds will be going to the polls or will it take a long time?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In response to the second question, I replied that it depends. The change proposed by Prop F will be rolled out November 2018, but the Board of Education still has to reform curriculae to prepare high school voters.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The goal is not just to get 16 and 17 year olds to the polls and to give an opportunity to youth who are passionate about actively engaging in their community; it’s also about increasing voter turnout. Of course, I think that 16 and 17 year olds, whether or not they support Prop F, will be eager to voice their opinions through casting ballots.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, Green and Dayton filmed us canvassing in the Sunset District. Unfortunately, most voters were too distracted by cameras pointed at their houses. After the cameras left, I got my first “yes.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But what’s important isn’t my experience with interviews and cameras; it’s that Yes on F deserves more media attention. There are so many unique aspects of this campaign: it is a youth-led, proactive step to promote more civic engagement in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The small town of Brisbane, directly south of San Francisco, has been forced to reckon with its own self-perception as a tight-knit, insular community. Recent efforts to build an entirely commercial project with no residential component at the vacant Brisbane Baylands site has drawn the ire of politicians from all sides of San Francisco’s political aisle.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At last night’s City Council meeting, housing advocates from San Francisco Housing Action Coalition (SFHAC) and Grow SF crowded the small chambers to support a proposal by developer United Paragon Corporation (UPC) to include over 4,000 residential units with office development. Mayor Cliff Lentz, hot off the heels of a media firestorm that erupted after he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/nevius/article/Brisbane-pushes-huge-development-without-housing-9237957.php&quot;&gt;implied&lt;/a&gt; San Francisco should shoulder the residential burden, was cautiously welcoming of all in attendance, including news cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Mayor insisted that he had been misquoted in the San Francisco &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, and that he had merely been paraphrasing different proposals for the Baylands site. Many older residents placed blame for the controversy squarely on UPC, which owns the land: “Let’s be very clear, we are not proposing only office space,” one speaker insisted; “the developer is.” But such statements are discrepant with UPC’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/brisbane-postpones-decision-on-baylands-project/&quot;&gt;actual proposal&lt;/a&gt;, in which 4,434 residential units would help offset the costs of cleaning up the toxic soil on the 684-acre former industrial site, now an informal landfill.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“This is a very routine, perfectly normal process,” said Tim Colen, a former geologist Executive Director of SFHAC. Colen pointed to recent development plans on Treasure Island as evidence of other sites where soil has been decontaminated to accommodate residential development.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Colen also blasted the traffic study in the proposal’s Environmental Impact Report, which the council was meeting to evaluate. “This measures Level Of Service, while the state of California is rapidly shifting to measuring Vehicle Miles Traveled. It’s a measure of how much a project could increase carbon emissions.” Indeed, while the traffic analysis showed that even leaving the land vacant would result in increased traffic congestion, Colen noted that the proposal with housing next to the Bayshore Caltrain station would have half the amount of greenhouse gas emissions as the strictly commercial alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Representatives from both Supvervisors Scott Wiener and Jane Kim, deadlocked in a bitter State Senate race, delivered statements in support of building housing on the Baylands. Lawmakers on both sides of the county border have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/nevius/article/Critics-go-to-town-on-Brisbane-plan-s-hostility-9393510.php&quot;&gt;raised&lt;/a&gt; the question of possible annexation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many Brisbane residents were irked by the notion that “outsiders” had come to demand regional cooperation. “I think you should allow Brisbane locals to speak first,” one resident told the council.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Councilmember Lori Liu took a cautiously skeptical view of the regional vs. local tension when addressing the city’s environmental consultant. “When we say ‘the community,’ what do we mean exactly?” She asked. “Do we mean just in Brisbane, the entire Bay Area, or the broader region as a whole?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mayor Lentz made the seemingly paradoxical remark that, although developing the Baylands was “a regional decision,” he considered it Brisbane’s responsibility to make the decision at the local level, because “that’s the way the law is.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When reached via email, UPC Director of Development Jonathan Scharffman offered the following comment: “I respect Brisbane’s pride in its heritage and its small-town character. However, if the City’s wants to deliver a world-class sustainable development for the Baylands site, housing must be part of the plan.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Brisbane will be holding a series of hearings on the site’s Environmental Impact Report, and will not hold a decisive vote until May 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Governor Jerry Brown signed more than 50 bills on Tuesday, including one allowing school districts to build affordable housing for school districts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1413&quot;&gt;SB1413&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by Senator Mark Leno (D-San Francisco), intends to stem the displacement of teachers and other school employees due to soaring housing costs. Previous efforts to harness the existing pipeline of housing production to help teachers, namely those &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfist.com/2016/02/02/campos_introduces_legislation_to_pr.php&quot;&gt;spearheaded&lt;/a&gt; by Supervisor David Campos, were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Housing-protection-for-teachers-is-ill-advised-6802223.php&quot;&gt;admonished&lt;/a&gt; for incurring risks of violating federal law and disincentivizing landlords from renting to teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The region’s educators mostly find themselves too highly paid to qualify for subsidized housing, but not wealthy enough to afford market-rate housing under current scarcity conditions. Leno’s bill would enable school districts to lease land for affordable housing construction, and allow housing projects for teachers to qualify for federal funding.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“When high quality teachers can’t afford to live where they work, the entire community suffers,” Senator Leno said via email. “Governor Brown’s approval of SB 1413 will help school districts directly address the housing affordability challenges facing teachers and reduce high turnover rates.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Last night, the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfhac.org/&quot;&gt;SFHAC&lt;/a&gt;) honored two “Housing Heroes” at their annual ceremony. This year’s honorees were Kim-Mai Cutler, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/&quot;&gt;firebrand journalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax&quot;&gt;Georgist&lt;/a&gt; stalwart of the YIMBY coalition, and Supervisor Katy Tang, who spearheaded last year’s controversial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hoodline.com/2015/11/city-planners-push-plan-for-more-density-affordability-across-sf-neighborhoods&quot;&gt;Affordable Housing Bonus Program&lt;/a&gt; (AHBP).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Under Tang’s leadership, the Board of Supervisors &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.curbed.com/2016/7/13/12173076/affordable-housing-density-program-sf&quot;&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; a three-story density bonus for 100% Below Market Rate housing construction, while incumbent property owners &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hoodline.com/2016/01/activists-fear-rezoning-plan-will-reduce-rent-controlled-housing-despite-assurances&quot;&gt;allied&lt;/a&gt; with myopic anti-gentrification groups to fight the rest of the bill’s provisions (almost entirely an implementation of already-existing state law). Meanwhile, Cutler’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/03/prop-f/&quot;&gt;exposées&lt;/a&gt; of California’s neofeudal land-use regime helped shape the discussion around housing affordability in the Bay Area to include a focus on the rising prices of existing real-estate, not just new construction.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As a representative of &lt;em&gt;BAMO&lt;/em&gt; and the SF YIMBY Party, I jumped at the chance to attend and be around &lt;em&gt;literal&lt;/em&gt; “developer shills”—an absurd epithet often thrown our way which, ironically, is entirely accurate of SFHAC. The nonprofit’s many industry members provide little to no funding for the &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; and affiliated operations, but those elbows were just waiting to be rubbed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In his introductory remarks, SFHAC’s outgoing Executive Director Tim Colen reminisced on past award ceremonies, one of which was held “at a tiny little bar in SoMa.” As a fan of greasy potato-based food served at dive bars, I briefly wished this had been the case that night.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The ceremony was scheduled from 6-8pm, exactly the range of time when my routine mandates dinner. Rather than schmooze with the assortment of real estate insiders filling up the ballroom, I focused my attention on the snacks. Uniformly tuxedoed waiters wandered the room, bearing neatly arranged hors d’oeuvres on varnished wooden trays. I teamed up with Corey Smith, SFHAC’s Community organizer, and made sure to sample each one, surprised both by excellence and mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As Corey corroborated, the night’s biggest surprise was the outstanding excellence of the miniature vegan Mu-Shu rolls. My biases should be laid bare here: I can’t resist a good starchy delicacy, and am particularly enraptured by all sorts of buns and noodles made with rice flour. (Prepackaged udon noodles remain a weekly staple on my grocery list.) The ardent omnivore in me was eager to scoff at a vegan dish, but like many vegan pastries I’ve tried in the past, they turned out to be the best snack of the night. Ingeniously tied together with a knotted string of green onion, whatever savory plant protein lay within perfectly contrasted with the sweet plum sauce in the dipping bowl. Much to the waiter’s annoyance, I’m sure, I chased those trays down for second and third helpings. Naturally, I forgot to take pictures of the best dish.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As ad hoc “Asian fusion” slowly dominates my Bay Area diet—I’ve been known to throw udon noodles into curries and chili stews—I soon found myself turning my back on, even spitting upon my roots.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini-crabcakes: an insult to parsley, inferior to red snapper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Amateur litigator Brian Hanlon, founder of the suburb-suing nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlaef.org/&quot;&gt;CaRLA-EF&lt;/a&gt;, insisted on seeing me sample a miniature taco. The very idea of it made my ancestors weep: a hardshell tortilla no larger than an olive, pre-folded, held half a bite’s worth of astonishingly dry pulled-pork and a tiny sliver of red onion. Benito Juarez, Frida Kahlo, and Emperor Moctezuma himself cursed me from their graves.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;My home state of Maryland prides itself on its crabcakes and not much else, save for maybe the highly processed, red-dyed salt &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bay_Seasoning&quot;&gt;condiment&lt;/a&gt; sometimes sprinkled onto crab meat. It’s unclear where the crab for these miniature crabcakes came from, but in my humble opinion the dish would have been better served by imitation crab, i.e. red snapper. In what should ideally be a delicate balance between starch and protein, starch won an uncontested victory. A trivial amount of grease was all that prevented these bites from disintegrating into crab granola in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A far more successful iteration of this concept came in the form of Caesar salad bites, an adorable fingerful of heavily-salted iceberg lettuce served in a thimble-shaped crouton.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/sfhac-honors-heroes-with-haughty-hors-doeuvres/hha2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iceberg lettuce and Caesar dressing in a crouton bowl: disruptive innovation in the miniature salad needspace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to tell when exactly the idea of miniaturized entrees replaced hors d’oeuvres of a naturally small size as the snack of choice for fancy cocktail parties. Is it the result of a sublimated craving for tacky freezer foods such as “bite-sized” pizza bagels, which the image-conscious bourgeoisie can only gorge on in secret? Or is it just the logical progression of gourmet consumerism making a mockery of itself?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Here’s where the parallel between the food and the developers become clear: the real-estate market responds to demands on a very short-term timescale. So does shitty food. When the Bay Area forcibly &lt;a href=&quot;https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/218071&quot;&gt;downzoned&lt;/a&gt; its quaintest neighborhoods’ capacity to house a growing population, developers had little incentive to fight for long-term gains, opting to bake themselves into the labyrinthine bureaucracies of local fiefdoms to build what little they could.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Think I’m exaggerating? You should have eavesdropped on the conversations I heard.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We tell our clients that getting permit approvals in San Francisco is easy—relative to, I don’t know…”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Nowhere, really.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Right, exactly—unless you know the right people, grease the right cogs, let us shepherd them through.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Byzantine permitting processes don’t ensure better housing gets built; it merely guarantees that future tenants will bear the cost for these “shepherds” in the form of higher rents.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder housing gets approved mostly through a “pay-to-play” system in this city. Supervisor Malia Cohen found herself in hot water recently for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/pay-play-comment-costs-supervisor-vote-potrero-hill-development/&quot;&gt;joking&lt;/a&gt; about it, much to the chagrin of Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who along with Jane Kim, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2016/06/24/sf-supervisors-aaron-peskin-residential-develop.html&quot;&gt;negotiated&lt;/a&gt; deals to exempt certain developers from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/supes-to-propose-charter-amendment-on-development/&quot;&gt;Proposition C’s&lt;/a&gt; 25% affordable requirement in exchange for withholding opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Another nameless interlocutor mentioned that at least 100,000 people drive into the Bay Area through the Altamont Pass every day for work. Though impossible to verify, examples abound of low-income &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/03/28/long-commute-to-silicon-valley-increasingly-the-norm-for-many/&quot;&gt;workers forced to commute&lt;/a&gt; from distant, car-dependent exurbs from Tracy to Stockton and Manteca. San Francisco’s Sierra Club chapter finds itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@leighabeckman/no-the-sf-sierra-club-is-not-being-threatened-by-real-estate-interests-7b81eb36dc05&quot;&gt;opting for sprawl&lt;/a&gt; over shadows, rather than advocating for the dense infill development near transit that is necessary to curb carbon emissions from cars, as its national chapter &lt;a href=&quot;http://vault.sierraclub.org/sprawl/community/smartgrowth.asp&quot;&gt;recognizes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;What on earth could explain this crowd of developers and their lobbyist cronies expressing such pent-up contempt for the property owners their predecessors so thanklessly served?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Above all, investors want certainty, just like I wanted the certainty of finding the taste and texture of crab when biting into a crabcake. For now, neither gets their wish. Even when a project offers lower returns to subsidize low-income housing units, in exchange for lower risk of a protracted permitting process, neighborhood activists demand more, financial feasibility be damned.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Incredulity abounded in the crowd over why anti-gentrification groups in the Mission focused all their attention on preserving the Mission’s built environment—“in amber,” someone said—as a metonym for its cultural environment, rather than directing their ire at the exclusive suburbs that ensure most production occurs in formerly affordable neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It’s a travesty that Palo Alto has only added 10,000 people since the seventies,” someone said. “Absolutely criminal. They should be sued for violating the Fair Housing Act. But where’s the political will for it? It’s busy blocking Google buses in the city.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But when the economy booms and there’s a surge of demand, migrants flock from areas of fewer opportunities, whether in this country or the rest of the world. Any kid with a computer can spend a year learning how to code and find a job in the Bay Area. I did—even though none of the jobs I worked at required me to write code, the wildly exaggerated coding experience on my resume gave me an advantage. (What is a Github? I still don’t really get it.) The real estate cabal I found myself drinking with and eavesdropping on will build the housing for them, no matter how much anyone screams about the evils of capitalism. If they can’t build in a wealthy low-density neighborhood where the influx of tech workers would be normal, then they’ll build in a more vulnerable community that didn’t zone future generations out because it couldn’t afford to: ergo, Rockridge and Elmwood, with their history of covenants and single-family zoning, see virtually none of the growth that is threatening to erode the diversity of Chinatown and West Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;After Cutler and Tang received their awards, and Tang shared her award with city staff, they returned to their seats directly in front of mine. “Good luck getting the rest of it through,” Cutler said to the Supervisor, evidently referring to the AHBP. “Oh my god, I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;,” Tang replied.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Capitalism won’t die tomorrow. I’m skeptical any momentum for such a thing could coalesce before the polar ice caps are fully melted, though we owe it to unborn children to hope for the best. On the other hand, there is more than enough political will to house the nouveau-riche in towering fishtanks casting shadows over multi-million dollar craftsman homes in white suburbia, with plenty of car-free options for getting around.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;If you want to eat the rich, it helps to have them living nearby. If you want to eat their food too, well, for me all it took was promising them I’d make fun of it.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A crowd gathered on the front steps of city hall, brandishing bright blue and yellow signs. Across the street, homeless San Franciscans slept in the plaza, and another crowd had formed to watch a soulful funk/reggae band. The civic-minded crowd, kicking off the campaign for &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfgov.org/elections/sites/default/files/Documents/candidates/Homeless%20Fund-%20Legal%20Text.pdf&quot;&gt;Propositions J&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfgov.org/elections/sites/default/files/Documents/candidates/General%20Sales%20Tax%20Legal%20Text.pdf&quot;&gt;K&lt;/a&gt;, preferred to call the music “jazz” for alliterative purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Welcome to our Jazzy Kickoff,” Mayor Ed Lee exclaimed, pausing to make sure the crowd picked up on his allusion to the campaign’s proposition letters. Lee spoke briskly about the need to maintain a reliable sales tax revenue stream to fund homelessness amid the city’s housing crisis, and to keep people moving amid worsening traffic gridlock. He stood flanked by many of San Francisco’s political elite, among them Supervisor Mark Farrell and Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing Director Jeff Kositsky.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, business as usual in Civic Center Plaza&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I’m proud of the efforts San Francisco has made in helping our homeless population,” Kositsky said during his turn at the dais. The director insisted that the $50 million per year the ballot measures would allocate to homelessness were critical to help and house the city’s approximately 3,500 living on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;All hands in sight shot upward when Kositsky worked the crowd: “Raise your hand if you’re here to end homelessness in San Francisco!”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A similar call went out to all transit riders when several public transit advocates took the stage. If passed, the measures would allocate over $100 million per year to fund MUNI improvements and subsidies for low-income riders.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Nicole Ferrara, Executive Director of Walk San Francisco, honed in on the urgency of J and K. “Every street in the Tenderloin is a high-injury corridor,” she said, asserting that the city spent more in treating injuries from motorist collisions than preventing them. Ferrara proceeded to lead the crowd in a dual cheer: “We need K!—To get J!”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Indeed, several speakers pointed to the inherently confusing nature of the ballot referendum system to underscore the need to pass both measures: “J is how the money gets spent; K is &lt;em&gt;the money&lt;/em&gt;!” In other words, Proposition J allocates funds for homeless services and transit improvements, but if the 0.75% sales tax increase under Proposition K fails to pass, there would be no additional revenue funding those services.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;After the cheer, the crowd coalesced on city hall’s granite steps for a group photo (into which this author was drafted) before quickly dispersing into the sunny afternoon. Some walked to their offices; others boarded buses; many others less fortunate, in all likelihood, had nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) issued &lt;a href=&quot;http://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3497&quot;&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; on California’s Proposition 13, a 1979 ballot measure limiting property taxes. The independent agency studied its effects on homeownership, tax revenue, and local government land use decisions nearly four decades after its passage.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Prop 13’s stated purpose was to bring property tax relief for homeowners. According to the LAO study, Prop 13 did have this effect for &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; homeowners, while increasing costs for other households. High-income homeowners earn the highest amount of tax relief, as high earners tend to own larger and more expensive homes, and essentially have more market value on which to accrue savings. However, the report does find that due to Prop 13, households in the same city or even same neighborhood face vastly different tax burdens, even on homes that have the same market value, and often even across similar age and income groups.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Prop 13 almost immediately depleted tax revenues, causing local governments to seek other funding sources to make up for the shortfall, namely sales, hotel, and utility taxes. It does not appear to have deterred the creation of new businesses, even though new businesses face a higher tax burden than their incumbent competitors. Moreover, reassessments (which reset the tax rate) are performed at the same rate for residential and commercial properties.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;With respect to local land use decisions, the LAO report finds that Prop 13 may have slowed the formation of new local governments, which now serve more residents than prior to the passage of Prop 13. The study also looks at the impact of Prop 13 on zoning decisions made by local governments, sampling 73 cities of similar size and populations with different tax revenue makeup (i.e. property tax versus sales tax) to evaluate any differences. It found that cities with higher property taxes did not tend to rezone for more housing, nor did cities with lower property taxes tend to rezone for less housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When developers seek to build new properties, the costs associated with that new development must be offset in other ways by local governments who can no longer solely rely on property taxes. Impact fees are one way to do this, and pose minimal political challenges as they do not require voter approval. However, impact fees raise the cost of construction, which in turn increase home and rental prices.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;California is not alone in imposing these fees; nearly half of states have them. However, according to this study, California’s fees were almost three times as high as the average across all the states in the survey. The report makes only brief mention of renters, positing that “landlords facing slower increases in their property tax bills may be less inclined to increase rents.” Due to the uncertainty of this effect, however, the LAO was unable to quantify those benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The final question posed by the study, and implicitly baked into the measure’s aim itself: Does Prop 13 increase homeownership?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The LAO finds the Prop 13 reduced homeownership costs for some households, namely retirees on fixed incomes in certain parts of the state. But in coastal California, it has not. Since Prop 13 required local governments to raise fees on home builders, costs for new young buyers have gone up, leading to a significant reduction in their homeownership rates. Prior to Prop 13, households ages 35 to 45 made up nearly two-thirds of all homebuyers. Now they make up less than half. Meanwhile, the share of Californians who are homeowners at all has remained largely unchanged, suggesting that households aged 45 and older have made up for the losses of younger aspiring homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While calls for Prop 13 reform have increased as of late, Governor Jerry Brown &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/news/amp/In-S-F-talk-Brown-says-he-won-t-refight-Prop-6555024.php&quot;&gt;recently stated&lt;/a&gt; he is not interested in fighting that battle. Brown, who vehemently opposed the bill when it was proposed in 1978, rejects proposals for a “split roll,” which would allow commercial properties to be assessed more frequently than they are currently, arguing that its implications are more complicated than proponents acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;At 7:30 PM tonight, the San Mateo Planning Commission will be reviewing permit applications for Hillsdale Terrace, a mixed-use development of 74 condos and 14,000 square feet of ground-floor retail within walking distance of the Hillsdale Caltrain station.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Owner LFG Properties are seeking to replace the underutilized site, formerly home of Taxi’s Hamburgers, with a five-story building that would implement the state density bonus law to include more affordable housing. LFG could legally receive by-right approval if they applied for a 35% density bonus, with 6 out of 67 dwelling units reserved for low-income households. But the property owner is seeking to build higher, proposing 74 units with 8 reserved for renters making &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; low incomes—effectively a 51% density bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The city's &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosm.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2842806&amp;amp;GUID=AC22E852-5976-49B7-AF09-6E4463B53198&quot;&gt;staff report&lt;/a&gt; recommending approval describes the proposed condo project as a “gateway” leading from El Camino Real to the quieter residential neighborhoods along 28th Avenue. The report also notes that developers will be contributing funds for landscaping the El Camino Real median between 27th and 28th Avenues, as well as improving crosswalks.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While some neighbors have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2016-09-27/planning-commission-gets-hillsdale-terrace-projecthigh-density-housing-sought-for-taxis-site/1776425168922.html&quot;&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; of traffic congestion and excessive height, the transportation advocacy group Friends Of Caltrain are strongly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greencaltrain.com/2016/09/san-mateo-planning-reviews-mixed-use-housing-across-from-hillsdale-caltrain/&quot;&gt;in support&lt;/a&gt; of the project. Adina Levin, Project Director of Friends Of Caltrain, shared the following statement via email: “This building is in a superb, transit-rich location, supporting the city's longstanding plans for the rail corridor and El Camino Real. We encourage and hope the city will move ahead with the well-established, effective strategies that provide much-needed housing and affordable housing, and take advantage of the great location.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Under the current proposal, the new building would provide 171 parking spaces, eight more than required by the city.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&quot;We can work together to break down rules that stand in the way of building new housing and
that keep families from moving to growing, dynamic cities.” A quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spur.org/&quot;&gt;SPUR&lt;/a&gt;? A real estate lobbyist? Your libertarian cousin? Guess again: that was President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The White House released a “Housing Development Toolkit” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/Housing_Development_Toolkit%20f.2.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; today urging cities to reduce zoning regulations and increase their housing stock to ease increasing trends of economic segregation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis is stated plainly: “In just the last 10 years, the number of very low-income renters paying more than half their income for rent has increased by almost 2.5 million households, to 7.7 million nationwide, in part because barriers to housing development are limiting housing supply.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Correlated with a drastic increase in local zoning and permitting regulations in American municipalities from 1970 to 1990, the paper notes a commensurate divergence in home prices and construction costs. While the cost of construction has remained relatively stable in the same time period, home prices skyrocketed. The paper suggests this growing gap is due to “land use restrictions that make developable land much more costly than it is inherently…and unnecessarily slow permitting processes.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/white-house-urges-zoning-reform-for-housing-affordability/potus1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The paper’s “toolkit” includes a number of wide-ranging policy recommendations, including by-right development, which failed to gain support in the California legislature earlier this summer. Other efforts to improve housing production, including the  elimination of minimum parking requirements, have recently been enacted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/oakland-modernizes-parking-regulations/&quot;&gt;Oakland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2015/10/05/berkeley-councilmember-lori-droste-proposes-reforms-to-prioritize-affordable-housing-over-parking&quot;&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The White House did acknowledge that there was a complex history to localized Not In My Back Yard attitudes, often motivated by concerns over human welfare. “Not all barriers to housing development have negative impacts,” the report notes, citing efforts that “can increase the supply of well-located affordable housing, address externalities such as environmental impacts associated with development, create better connections between housing options accessible to transit, and support the fiscal health of states and localities. But the accumulation of even well-intentioned land-use policies can restrict housing availability; create uncertainty for developers and limit private investment; exacerbate the imbalance between jobs and housing; and induce urban sprawl.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Last week, Governor Jerry Brown alluded to these very restrictions at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/In-S-F-talk-Brown-says-he-won-t-refight-Prop-6555024.php&quot;&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the Urban Land Institute in SF’s Moscone Center. The veteran politician extolled the virtues of judiciously picking one’s battles, and for him, addressing the shortcomings of the California Environmental Quality Act was not a top choice. “Reform of CEQA is the Lord’s work,” Brown said, “but unfortunately the Lord’s work doesn’t always get done.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/study-finds-rampant-ceqa-abuse-in-southern-california/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 99% of CEQA litigation in Southern California targeted infill development of multifamily residences, rather than greenfield development in rural areas commonly associated with urban sprawl. As for maintaining a balance of market-rate and permanently affordable housing, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/over-three-months-prop-c-has-reduced-production-of-affordable-housing/&quot;&gt;study by this paper&lt;/a&gt; confirmed San Francisco Controller Ben Rosenfield’s warnings that too high of a requirement could hinder the net production of housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Although growth is certainly happening in high-demand cities, the White House makes the case that this growth is not being distributed equitably, and can harm lower-income communities of color the most. “When new housing development is limited region-wide, and particularly precluded in neighborhoods with political capital to implement even stricter local barriers, any new development tends to be disproportionally concentrated in low-income communities of color, causing displacement and concerns of gentrification in those neighborhoods, raising market rents within neighborhoods experiencing rapid changes while failing to reduce housing cost growth region-wide.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Longer commutes from exurbs to job centers are only the beginning of an ongoing cascade of inequities that arise when growth is concentrated in areas such as The Mission or South Berkeley, for example, while affluent neighborhoods such as North Berkeley or Telegraph Hill remain virtually untouched.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Canvassing and phone banking are essential parts of any campaign, and Yes on F has just started last weekend in the Richmond District.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A group of eight high school students from Lowell, St. Ignatius, and City Arts and Tech gathered at the Velo Rouge Cafe on Saturday morning. This was the first official door-knocking event of the campaign, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ngpvan.com/&quot;&gt;miniVAN&lt;/a&gt; system (the app for the Voter Activation Network)  had not been completely set up yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Celi Tamayo-Lee, the campaign’s adult coordinator, handed out paper lists and pens. Fighting against the cold wind, each pair of partners scrambled to organize the papers in order of streets. At least half of the group’s members were canvassing for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A practice round, with one person acting as the canvasser and the other a voter, helped calm nerves. After a cheer of “Vote16,” the group dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As I rang on the first doorbell, my partner and I exchanged anxious glances. My hand trembled as I gripped the script in the other. Then the door was opened, revealing a friendly woman's face.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Except for a few fumbles, we smoothly started a conversation. I wasn't a first-timer to canvassing, but this was my first time directly interacting with a voter on behalf of Vote16.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The conversation went well, ending with the voter saying that she would vote yes on F.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The best experience, however, came from a Republican who said that she would support us.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;She empathized with the “Why 16” argument, saying that “life gets in the way,” so it would be better to form voting as a habit earlier. Also, she added, sixteen year olds are more open to different perspectives, as they are still trying to form their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The other Republican I convinced asked, “Why didn't this happen earlier?” and said to his two-year-old son, “You're going to be able to vote in fourteen years!”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;As director of the newly-minted Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, Jeff Kositsky arguably has the most challenging job in San Francisco. Though the Department for the most part remains in preliminary planning stages, Kositsky made a gesture of “radical transparency” yesterday by answering questions from anonymous users on Reddit, using the site’s popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/541co2/hi_reddit_im_jeff_kositsky_and_im_the_director_of/?st=itg33n9v&amp;amp;sh=4ba60852&quot;&gt;“Ask Me Anything”&lt;/a&gt; forum style on the r/sanfrancisco page.&lt;/p&gt;

He cited San Francisco among the top three cities he thinks are addressing homelessness the best, alongside Houston and Salt Lake City. “There are not more homeless people/capita in SF than in other similar cities,” he wrote as a preemptive answer to questions he anticipated. “It is more visible here because most services are in the central part of the city.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Several answers underscored both an excessive stigma on mental illnesses, and a paucity of services tailored to addressing those needs. Reddit user Gorakos noted in their question: “It seems that that subpopulation only ever receives emergency care but has nowhere to go but back to the streets following an exit from the hospital/police station/shelter.” Kositsky replied that Direct Access to Housing programs (DAH) showed great promise for curbing the cycle of poverty among the mentally ill, pairing permanent housing with on-site services. “They look and feel no different than the market rate housing around them and are way cheaper than folks coming in and out of the public health system, jail, etc,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kositsky also pointed to future plans of a navigation center for mental health issues, as well as leveraging new MediCal funds to increase mental health services. Kositsky’s predecessor Bevan Dufty had championed the opening of the first “navigation center” in the Mission District, which combines shelter beds with storage for possessions and services for both singles and families. Dufty abruptly quit his post earlier this year, later &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/mutual-respect-admiration-dominates-bart-director-race/&quot;&gt;citing&lt;/a&gt; disagreements on the clearing of homeless encampments near Super Bowl City.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Director repeated in many answers that one of his top priorities was consolidating 13 databases into one data system for tracking the city’s homeless population and the services they needed. Kositsky told the Reddit user Acccounttt that he expected a timeline of 12 months to quantify the effectiveness of current homeless services. At this time, the city holds over 400 contracts with 76 different organizations to provide services for the homeless. Though he could not disclose the vendor for the department’s new data system, he promised a “real time dashboard on our website” upon its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most strikingly, Kositsky urged respondents to move past the narrative of scapegoating the tech industry for the homelessness and poverty in the city. When one user asked him how tech companies could “improve their reputation,” he responded: “I do not believe any particular sector can be blamed for homelessness. The federal government stopped investing in affordable housing in any meaningful way in 1978. There are also some perverse incentives in the way our real estate market works.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Regarding the “perverse incentives,” Kositsky elaborated in another answer: “Homelessness is a failure of our real estate market to meet the needs of low-income individuals. Interesting that the biggest housing subsidy program is the mortgage interest tax deduction.” In other words, federal policy has been subsidizing middle class homeownership for decades, while leaving homeless services scrambling for grants and local sales tax initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many major tech companies, he noted, and contributed much-needed funding, labor, and expertise to the new department. Aside from donating and volunteering, Kositsky added, “about 5 tech companies sent senior engineers to our offices to help us make the final decision on the SAS [Statistical Analysis System] product we are using for our new database. Poor vendor had the hardest interview ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kositsky’s ambition is not only to efficiently track the city’s progress, but to take that progress as far as possible by &lt;em&gt;solving homelessness.&lt;/em&gt; In response to a question about “measurable effects,” Kositsky plainly stated: “[e]nd veterans homelessness by 2019, reduce street homelessness by 50% in 2019, end family homelessness by 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Reddit user raldi responded by setting a reminder for themselves to check back on December 31st, 2018: “How’d he do?” San Franciscans of all walks of life will be asking the same question in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;These past few were likely among the most nerve-wracking in Supervisor London Breed’s career. After facing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Feds-reject-housing-plan-meant-to-help-minorities-9146987.ph&quot;&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt;p at the federal level against her Neighborhood Preference Ordinance, the Supervisor &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/breed-vows-to-fight-for-neighborhood-preference-ordinance/&quot;&gt;resisted amid rumors&lt;/a&gt; that her opponents had been conspiring with local representatives of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This week, HUD &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Federal-agency-OKs-preferences-at-new-SF-senior-9238463.php?cmpid=twitter-mobile&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that they would allow neighborhood preference to determine the lottery for the Willie B. Kennedy apartments, although they still opposed the legislation overall.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Breed held a press conference this morning in front of the Willie B. Kennedy apartments in the Western Addition to announce the favorable ruling. The lottery for senior housing units in Willie B. Kennedy had been postponed pending HUD’s decision. Now nearby seniors will have drastically improved chances of winning a subsidized apartment, which Breed views as essential to stemming the loss of San Francisco’s black population. (The city’s African-American population has dwindled to around 5%, while also comprising  over 50% of jail inmates.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Passed unanimously by the Board of Supervisors last year, the law gives preference to residents within the supervisorial district (or within a half-mile radius otherwise) in the lottery for Below Market Rate units. Breed lobbied federal officials, including Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Diane Feinstein, and flew to Washington, DC with housing officials from Mayor Ed Lee’s office to meet with HUD representatives in defense of her legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Breed also published an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/powdered-milk-moving-vans-fight-affordable-housing/&quot;&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; today in the San Francisco &lt;em&gt;Examiner&lt;/em&gt; excoriating her opponents for criticizing her record on affordable housing. The supervisorial campaign by millionaire homeowner Dean Preston is supported by local tenant groups, which Breed notes were unwilling to help residents of public housing when her own family faced eviction. Supervisor Breed, who was raised in the projects that once stood across from Willie B. Kennedy, noted that her place of residence had just been sold after the landlord’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Even a San Francisco Supervisor who lobbied federal officials in her efforts to curb displacement faces an uncertain future in her city.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Developers at Lennar Urban received a crushing blow to their plans to develop 12,000 new homes and office space at the Hunters Point Shipyard, from none other than the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA ordered the Mayor’s Office of Housing and the U.S. Navy to halt the transfer of land in the former shipyard after soil tests conducted by Tetra Tech were found to have been falsified.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The former naval yard housed a military research facility for nuclear weapons, leaving behind deadly radioactive soil when it closed in 1994. After two decades of cleanup and even some new apartments filling up with tenants, the Navy has admitted that its contractor, Tetra Tech, took soil samples from a clean site and passed them off as samples from the once-contaminated shipyard. The accusations were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1604/ML16042A074.pdf&quot;&gt;corroborated&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Indeed, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.curbed.com/2016/9/22/13013980/hunters-point-radiation-epa&quot;&gt;Curbed SF points out&lt;/a&gt;, Tetra Tech quite literally covered up the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The federal agency’s understandable caution still provoked concern among city officials struggling to mitigate effects of the regional housing shortage. Mayor Ed Lee and Supervisor Malia Cohen, whose district encompasses Hunters Point, sent a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/324834306/9-19-16-Mayor-Lee-Sup-Cohen-Hunters-Point-Shipyard-Letter?content=10079&amp;amp;ad_group=Online+Tracking+Link&amp;amp;campaign=Skimbit%2C+Ltd.&amp;amp;keyword=ft500noi&amp;amp;source=impactradius&amp;amp;medium=affiliate&amp;amp;irgwc=1&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the EPA requesting a (“confidential if necessary”) briefing so they could understand just how long an investigation of Tetra Tech’s soil analysis could take. The 12,000 total units now stalled in the pipeline make up more than 10% of San Francisco’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/leveling-sf-housing-field-could-take-100000-new-units/Content?oid=2703869&quot;&gt;estimated housing need&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, plans call for 1,400 new homes to be completed by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;For the thousands of people struggling to find a home in San Francisco, the EPA’s delay spells a stark choice between commuting from distant suburbs, or risking a miniature Chernobyl in their own back yard.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The June 2016 election of the San Francisco Democratic County Central Committee was one of the most expensive in its history, with a record breaking $2.3 million reported spent. However, illustrating the adage that “money don’t vote,” the big spenders’ candidates &lt;a href=&quot;http://48hills.org/2016/06/07/lessons-june-7-election/&quot;&gt;mostly failed to win seats&lt;/a&gt; on the committee.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Reporting by the Reform slate friendly blog &lt;em&gt;48 Hills&lt;/em&gt; decried outsized spending on the Progress slate &lt;a href=&quot;http://48hills.org/2016/05/27/1-million-tech-real-estate-money-pours-june-sf-election/&quot;&gt;by a few donors&lt;/a&gt; - $25K from Ron Conway; $21K from Robert Rosania, developer of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2015/03/the-monster-in-the-mission-makes-its-case/&quot;&gt;“Monster in the Mission”&lt;/a&gt;; $50K each from Google; Facebook; Evan Williams, the founder of Medium; and $30K from Kevin Systrom, founder of Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Having swept the election, two members of the Reform slate, Petra DeJesus and Pratima Gupta, now seek to prevent large donations by amending SF Democratic Party by-laws to prevent donations to candidates in excess of $500. The amendment exempts the candidates themselves from this limitation. The proposed amendment reads,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Section 5:  LIMITS ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO CANDIDATES FOR THE SF DCCC.&lt;br&gt;
No person &lt;em&gt;other than a candidate&lt;/em&gt; shall make, and no campaign treasurer for a candidate committee shall solicit or accept, any contribution which will cause the total amount contributed by such person to such candidate committee in an election to exceed $500.” (emphasis added)
&lt;a href=&quot;https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/sfdemocrats/pages/13/attachments/original/1474328101/SFDCCC_10-day_Notice_Agenda.pdf?1474328101&quot;&gt;See page 19 for full resolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A DCCC member who declined to be named said, “It is ludicrous to say we should have contribution limits and then allow famous (or already rich) people to run - people who don't have to raise a dime to win.” For niche elections like the Democratic County Central Committee, elections are won and lost because of name recognition, which favors established incumbents. 12 of the 24 newly elected DCCC members are current or former Supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“This resolution would cripple an actual grassroots campaign for the DCCC,” claims Sonja Trauss, local organizer and co-owner of this paper. “A grassroots candidate, with no name recognition, has to canvass heavily in order to win. Time a candidate spends asking for money is time not spent asking for votes. One $5,000 donation saves the candidate from having to ask 10 people for $500, or, more likely, 100 people for $50 each. I wouldn’t argue with a resolution prohibiting actual large donations - $50,000 at a time. Limiting the contributions to small donations protects the people that are introducing the amendment - incumbents.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Another agenda item to watch on Wednesday is Chairperson Cindy Wu’s appointment of a new SF DCCC member due to a vacancy. Leading up the the June DCCC election, a rumour circulated that the DCCC was going to be stacked with high-profile elected officials who, after winning handily without spending any money, would vacate their seats and allow the new chair to replace them with a Democrat of the chair’s choice. The identity of the outgoing DCCC member is not yet known. If it does turn out to be a high profile elected, the rumor will be on its way to being substantiated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The next DCCC meeting will be held on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfdemocrats.org/meetings&quot;&gt;September 28th, 7pm at 455 Golden Gate Ave.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Last night, the Oakland City Council voted unanimously to upgrade its parking requirements for the first time in over 50 years. Oakland last revised its parking requirements for new development in the downtown area back in 1965. Councilmember Abel Guillen celebrated on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Abel_Guillen/status/778454029898612736&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, writing, “Hello 21st Century.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;City staff &lt;a href=&quot;https://oakland.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2825408&amp;amp;GUID=CA5A731F-E886-4E19-ADBC-EF00056A817C&amp;amp;Options=&amp;amp;Search=&quot;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; the update in accordance with the 1996 Transit First Policy, as well as Oakland’s current Climate Action Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The changes will affect Downtown Oakland most drastically, replacing the previous 1.25:1 minimum parking-to-housing ratio with a 1.25:1 maximum for parking—no minimum. There is an exception for senior housing, which would receive by-right approval to provide one parking space for every four dwelling units. Commercial space is now limited by a maximum of one parking space for every 300 square feet of ground-floor retail.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;There are many more nuances to this legislation, including allowances for car-sharing services such as Zipcar. We recommend this summary on local blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaktownacorn.com/2016/09/20/reducing-parking-for-increased-affordability/&quot;&gt;The Oaktown Acorn&lt;/a&gt; for the full scoop.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cami Doo is a junior at St. Ignatius College Preparatory and a special correspondent for the Metro Observer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco’s Proposition F, commonly called &lt;a href=&quot;http://vote16sf.org/&quot;&gt;Vote16&lt;/a&gt;, is a ballot measure that seeks to expand voting rights to 16 and 17 year olds in local and school board elections.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This campaign began in January 2015 when the Youth Commission passed a resolution urging the Mayor and Board of Supervisors to lower the voting age to 16. Two months later, , four Supervisors proposed a charter amendment. Fast forward to May 2016, the Board of Supervisors voted 9-2 to add Vote16 to the November 2016 ballot.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This effort is spearheaded by the Youth Empowerment Academy (YEA) and Generation Citizen’s Celi Tamayo-Lee The YEA includes youth ranging from ages 13 to 17 as well as a few adults. Generation Citizen is a nationwide non-profit organization whose goal is to instill long-term civic engagement into young students, and the YEA was born from the SF Youth Commission’s Civic Engagement Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Along the way, the campaign has collected many important endorsements. The San Francisco Democratic Party (DCCC), Nancy Pelosi, and all the Board of Education commissioners stand beside Yes on Prop F.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Prop F’s goal is to increase SF’s historically low voter turnout.  In fact, voter turnout in SF was 29% in Nov. 2013, 53% in Nov. 2014, and 45% in Nov. 2015. Other countries, on the other hand, enjoy a 80-90% voter turnout.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This non-partisan measure hopes to re-energize the electorate’s excitement about voting with a phenomenon known as the “trickle-up effect.” This effect will spread voter participation to parents and peers, increasing turnout all around (McDevitt and Kiousis 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sixteen year-olds are embedded in their communities. 18 is a transitional age; students are moving elsewhere and do not prioritize voting. At 16, however, students can have informed discussions about the election with their teachers and parents. Therefore, when they go to the polls, they should be educated on all perspectives of the ballot issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Prop. F is certainly not a panacea for our low voter turnout, but it is a promising step in strengthening our democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday of last week, the &lt;em&gt;East Bay Times (EBT)&lt;/em&gt; published an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/09/13/editorial-reject-barts-3-5-billion-bond-measure-east-bay-times/&quot;&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; opposing Measure RR, a $3.5 billion bond to finance regional BART improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This was an absurd position to take. BART’s weekday ridership has increased by 30% over the last 5 years, now averaging &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/BART-can-t-keep-pace-with-rising-crush-loads-6192950.php&quot;&gt;420,000&lt;/a&gt;. Without sufficient funding, this high demand has faced increasingly frequent train delays, breakdowns, and packed trains. During rush hour trains, commuters are often forced to let several trains pass by before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Funds for capital improvements are needed yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;East Bay Times tells a boldfaced lie when claiming that up to a third of the bond revenue could go toward offsetting labor costs, rather than system upgrades and improvements. Doing so would violate California &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;amp;group=16001-17000&amp;amp;file=16720-16727&quot;&gt;state law&lt;/a&gt;. BART legally cannot use bond funds for anything except for acquisition of capital assets, or grants or loans related to those specific costs.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;BART projects capital needs of $9.6 billion over the next ten years. It has $4.8 billion already lined up, and would use the $3.5 billion bond revenue to cover part of the shortfall. BART is about 50% covered on capital funds needed, and needs taxpayers to help out with the rest. The full $3.5 billion in bond revenues must, by law, go to capital expenditures, i.e. system upgrades and improvements. BART cannot reach into the bond revenue bucket to pay its employees. Calling this “offsetting labor costs” is a pretty big stretch. Put another way, even if BART holds on to $1.2 billion for operating revenues, it would still have a $3.5 billion capital expenditure shortfall. This whole discussion of labor costs is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As for the timing and tax burden property owners will face as a result of the bond issuance, BART has been forthright and clear about the bond repayment timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EBT&lt;/em&gt; argues that BART is misleading voters about the bond repayment timeline, since bond payments will actually be spread out over 48 years, and the text of the measure just refers to 30-year bonds. If you don’t look further into it, you might assume the tax will be paid over 30 years. But BART isn’t hiding this timeline at all. This information is included in the text of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acgov.org/rov/elections/20161108/documents/BondMeasureRR.pdf&quot;&gt;the measure itself&lt;/a&gt;, and is publicly available on its website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;BART anticipates that each bond will be paid off within 30 years &lt;em&gt;after it is issued&lt;/em&gt;, but BART won’t issue all of the bonds at the same time. Why borrow money before you need it? Instead, BART projects it will issue the $3.5 billion in bonds in equal installments every two years for eighteen years as the funds are needed to rebuild the aging system. This means that, from start to finish, &lt;em&gt;BART estimates property owners could be helping BART pay off the bonds for 48 years&lt;/em&gt;. (Emphasis added.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Issuing the bonds as needed is actually far more economical than issuing all at once, and is exactly the kind of forward thinking we want from our transportation agencies. By issuing bonds as needed, taxpayers will not have to pay additional interest on bonds that are not yet being used.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;East Bay Times&lt;/em&gt; tells us the tax in question would require property owners to shell out not the $37, $42, and $52 annually initially promised (per city), but potentially twice that. In fact, the total bill could even go up to &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; times the anticipated amount, up to $150-200 annually.. 
This might possible in a technical sense; the maximum annual interest rate permitted by law is 12%. However, BART’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/BART%20%243%205%20Billion%20GO%20Bond%20Measure%20Tax%20Analysis%20%284%25%20AV%20Growth%20Assumption%29%20Summary%20FINAL%20WEBSITE%20POSTING%208%2019%2016.pdf&quot;&gt;internal estimates&lt;/a&gt; peg the rate at 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;What basis does &lt;em&gt;EBT&lt;/em&gt; have for assuming this rate would more than double? Interestingly, the only evidence that backs up the 4x tax claim by the &lt;em&gt;East Bay Times&lt;/em&gt; op-ed is a link to another &lt;em&gt;East Bay Times&lt;/em&gt; article, a page &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/09/07/borenstein-bart-%E2%80%A6e-original-claim/&quot;&gt;which no longer exists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Even if the paper’s speculative math were correct, the worst case scenario of this measure is that the people in the Bay Area who own some of the most valuable real estate in the country would have to contribute something like $12-16 a month toward a critical regional service (rather than the forecasted $8-12 per month).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;To that point, we all know that a huge driver of our funding gap arises from &lt;a href=&quot;http://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3497&quot;&gt;Proposition 13&lt;/a&gt;, a statewide ballot initiative passed in 1978 that capped property taxes at its assessed value at the time of the sale, with increases limited to 1% each year. Without this necessary funding from corporate landowners and wealthy homeowners, our regional services have gone chronically underfunded. The cumulative impact of this measure nearly four decades later has proven disastrous for many services, including education and transit.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The cap on property taxes has forced the state to rely on nickel-and-dime fundraising strategies, such as increases in the sales tax, income tax, parcel taxes, and bonds to fund many public services. Most of these funding tactics are regressive in nature, putting an additional financial burden on lower-income residents.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Arguing that “BART needs to earn our trust” after past financial blunders is not a grudge we have the luxury of holding. The Bay Area is not going to stop growing. Urban think tank SPUR estimates that at the current rate of ridership growth, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/think-tank-calls-for-second-bart-transbay-tube/&quot;&gt;BART’s capacity will be exceeded by 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Wagging our finger at BART for past mismanagement will not solve our regional mass transit deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The bond measure requires the creation of an independent audit committee, comprised of six professionals from various backgrounds, including public accounting, engineering, and project management. Skepticism toward the audit committee’s effectiveness should not undermine the clear need to fund improvements for BART.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that BART will not perfectly maximize use of this revenue? Of course. That is a risk with any use of taxpayer money. If you are frustrated about “platinum” labor contracts afforded to BART employees, fine. But trying to stick it to a station agent by withholding tax money for capital improvements doesn’t change the station agent’s salary.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The loser of not passing the BART bond measure isn’t BART - it’s all of us. The BART Bond would benefit everyone, from those commuting on BART to those driving through lighter traffic, grateful that others are taking public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco is in mourning after Chinatown’s iconic political activist Rose Pak passed away in her home on Sunday morning. Ms. Pak, who grew up in Macau and Hong Kong as a Chinese refugee, relocated to San Francisco in 1967, and was involved in the city’s inner political circles ever since. At the mayor’s request, the city’s flags have been lowered to half-staff in her honor today.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As the only Cantonese-speaking reporter for the San Francisco &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, Pak covered Chinatown with assiduous discipline. Her career as an activist came to dominate the neighborhood after she championed efforts to save Chinese Hospital, a medical facility serving lower-income residents who mostly spoke Cantonese.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Pak was also instrumental in bringing San Francisco’s current Mayor Ed Lee to power. After she lobbied for his appointment to the administration of Mayor Art Agnos, Lee remained an important figure in local politics, and Pak successfully pushed for his appointment as interim mayor to replace Gavin Newsom. She subsequently led the “Run Ed Run” campaign to convince Lee to run for a successful reelection bid.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the two &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/A-gravely-ill-Rose-Pak-on-life-death-and-her-6456189.php&quot;&gt;soured&lt;/a&gt; when Lee appointed Julie Christensen over Pak’s chosen favorite, Cindy Wu, to replace David Chiu as Supervisor of District 3. In retaliation, Pak encouraged former Supervisor Aaron Peskin to run for the position, successfully ousting the appointee and rebalancing the Board of Supervisors in favor of the “progressive” faction.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though often labeled a “power broker,” Pak was fond of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Rose-Pak-SF-political-powerhouse-dies-9230594.php&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;, “if I were white, they’d call me a civic leader.” Pak will be missed dearly for her ribald conversational style and convivial demeanor. You can watch a sample of her fiery speaking style below:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;When I returned from vacation in Mexico this January, I rolled my luggage straight to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ratskin.org/&quot;&gt;Ratskin Records&lt;/a&gt; anniversary party in West Oakland. The legendary Bastard Noise played a devastatingly loud set, true to their name, that could be heard with perfect clarity around the block. I finished a bottle of heavily discounted tequila I’d brought straight from the Distrito Federal with several friends, including Mike Daddona, the local impresario who had organized the mini-festival. Since then, he’s released at least ten new albums, hosted a visual art exhibition, and organized several dozen concerts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;All in his spare time. “I do it to stay sane,” he says sometimes. “I’m not sure I’d know how to stop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Ratskin brand carries some clout in Oakland. The avant-garde, the macabre, the lurid or confrontational musicians especially know, just by word of mouth, “not just &lt;em&gt;anybody&lt;/em&gt; gets on Ratskin.” The catalog has been expanding all while repping almost exclusively the best of the East Bay: the lusty dance-pop icon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/maya-songbird-writes-music-for-the-wild-and-weird/Content?oid=4647422&quot;&gt;Maya Songbird&lt;/a&gt;, feminist-noise reggaetón duo &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2016/05/04/wrecking-the-patriarchy-with-oakland-reggaeton-duo-las-sucias/&quot;&gt;Las Sucias&lt;/a&gt;, and mystical hip-hop crooner Tyler Holmes are just some examples of local acts the label has touted lately, all who do much more than just make weird noises by turning knobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDlTgY5n5_c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3974232074/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/&quot; seamless&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ratskinrecords.bandcamp.com/album/maya-songbird-queen-of-darkness-ep&quot;&gt;MAYA  SONGBIRD &amp;quot;QUEEN OF DARKNESS&amp;quot; EP by Maya Songbird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Voltage Drop, the monthly “industrial danceclub” concert series, effectively functions as press releases for new Ratskin releases, with a smattering of unaffiliated but much-revered artists as well. In the coming weeks, Daddona announced with a rare sense of cheer, he’d be hosting “five fucking incredible friends, out-of-this-world talented, like nothing else out there.” Tyler Holmes debuts his new cassette album &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ratskin.org/releases/rsr067.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invisible Island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the Legionnaire Saloon on September 30th. On October 15th, the not-even-remotely-secret Oakland Secret Gallery will host a quadruple release party with Maya Songbird, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ratskinrecords.bandcamp.com/album/slanted-square-three-sides-released-oct-15&quot;&gt;Slanted Square&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/best-tape-loop-manipulator/BestOf?oid=1921316&quot;&gt;Loachfillet&lt;/a&gt;, and Mike’s own industrial noise project Malocculsion.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mike lives in the McClymonds neighborhood of West Oakland, a triangular area bounded by San Pablo, Peralta, and West Grand Avenues. He shares a two-story loft with three roommates, each bedroom separated from shared space with curtains. Still, the oasis of a living room emerges in the middle of several shelves of records and tapes, which stored both his personal collection and his business. The room itself speaks to his endless productivity: next to his desk, there are approximately eight cassette-dubbing machines stacked on top of each other, forming a chain through which he is constantly recording copies of his releases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'll put in tapes while I'm cooking dinner, cleaning the house, sitting around, or doing chores. I can pretty much work on the label whenever I'm home,&quot; he remarked. His living room, in other words, is a small pressing plant.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;He took out a record and started spinning some shrieking black metal from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzJecjdXXfI&quot;&gt;Gorgoroth&lt;/a&gt;, which made his visibly stressed and jittery roommate sigh and exclaim, “this is such calming music. I feel so relaxed now. Thanks, guys.” A deeply unusual atmosphere of sound came to life in the living room, the trickle of rapidfire trap-beats from the window curdling through the bass-heavy metal riffs.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunset in West Oakland's McClymonds neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;For its quiet suburban appearance, McClymonds feels much more dense and vibrant than comparably whiter, wealthier districts such as Rockridge. Mike’s neighbors, almost all black, were out on the sidewalks, blasting music out of their cars, or otherwise soaking up the sunset. For all the groceries and amenities readily available in more upscale suburbs, West Oakland’s food desert has the culture and mixed-use density those suburbs lack. Large warehouses adjoin single-family (yet often multi-household) homes, apartments, and parks. Underground music and art spaces flourish in the area’s once-cheap industrial spaces, many landlords being eager to cash in by turning a blind eye to the legal grey area of non-residential zoning.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Artists move to industrial spaces where they can be loud late at night,” former McClymonds resident Max Allstadt told me once. “You can divvy up the square footage with more roommates to split the rent, and neighbors don’t freak out if you cut sheet metal with a saw at 3 A.M.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood is both one of opportunity, drawing flocks of migrants for decades, and also limited opportunity, serving as an obvious reference point when discussing the region’s crippling social inequality. Daddona himself moved here for opportunity, from rural Connecticut. “I lived in a tiny town with nothing going on, so one day I just packed up and left. There were other reasons too, that I don’t want to discuss.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;West Oakland became a primarily black neighborhood after postwar industry boomed, attracting floods of African American migrants seeking work in the Port of Oakland and nearby manufacturing hubs. While segregationist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/&quot;&gt;redlining&lt;/a&gt; prevented Oakland’s black population from moving north, a period of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Seventh_Street_in_Oakland&quot;&gt;“urban renewal”&lt;/a&gt; decimated the community’s economic stability. First, the construction of the 980 freeway isolated West Oakland from the rest of the city, and then entire city blocks were razed for the construction of BART and the massive Post Office. Very little is left of the once-flourishing 7th Street Business District, though traces of the subsequent resistance by the Black Panthers remain in plain sight, primarily in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://qilombo.org/&quot;&gt;Qilombo&lt;/a&gt; community center.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It’s apparent, even in the most insular of the micro-subcultures that inevitably blossom here, that the demographic transition known as “gentrification” occurred before, or concurrently with, the inflation of real estate prices better known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/stanford-law-policy-review/print/2014/01/mangin_25_stan._l._poly_rev_91.pdf&quot;&gt;“reverse filtering.”&lt;/a&gt; That is, even the most recent transplant, in a warehouse party full of white college-aged carpetbaggers, knows how to allude to some nostalgic Shangri-La past that is rapidly receding.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I thought I had prepared with my most trustworthy stock question for an artist, intended to give a platform for a long, descriptive history of their work. “Did you think when you started this label, you would have expected to be where you are now?” Boom. Perfect. Surely this would prompt him to tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;His candor disarmed my clumsy cleverness. “Mm, yeah, I didn’t really think anything, really. We just did it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Okay, so that didn’t work,” I admitted after an awkward pause. “Just tell me how you started, and, you know, we can go from there.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The “we” refers to his former band Sabreteeth, which technically started the imprint on their own with only minimal input from Daddona at first. They sound somewhat like a more punk-sounding forefather to current band Coral Remains (nee Styrofoam Sanchez), all featuring macabre visuals, psychedelic costumes, and pummeling industrial drumbeats. Coral Remains, a trio of Mike, his roommate JSon, and former roommate Ryan King (a.k.a. Bonus Beast), are notorious for littering the floors of venues across the country with audience-involved Styrofoam-smashing antics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&quot;border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4123571802/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/&quot; seamless&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ratskinrecords.bandcamp.com/album/styrofoam-sanchez-empire-underwater&quot;&gt;STYROFOAM SANCHEZ &amp;quot;Empire Underwater&amp;quot; by Ratskin Records&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ratskin.org/thirteenseconds.html&quot;&gt;Triskaidekaphobia&lt;/a&gt; compilation CD in 2008, the imprint expanded into releasing other artists' material: specifically, 215 artists, each presenting a 13-second song. By the time Styrofoam Sanchez released their monolithic LP/DVD/comic book album &lt;em&gt;Empire Underwater&lt;/em&gt; in 2014, Ratskin was a very different beast. Mike had long since taken over operations after the first handful of Sabreteeth recordings, and his visual art on most album covers was more prevalent than any music he recorded himself.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It was never intentional, Mike insists. It’s as though he didn’t think about what he was doing until he was well into the process of running a record label. “It was just a fun, kind of absurd project. After that, it was mostly other people’s music. It just sort of happened. All of a sudden, I realized, ‘wow, so many of my friends are so talented and so hardworking.’ It just made sense to help them out as much as I could.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;What strikes me so often about artists who move to the Bay Area, just as much as those who were born here, is their instinctive yet consciously irrational drive to do so. They just do what they do because they have to, full stop.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;To Mike, it’s even “therapeutic.” It occurs to me if so many people are willing to take a financial loss to find purpose through the help of therapy, it seems odd that it is far less taboo to criticize the logical utility of art than that of psychological counseling. Perhaps we recognize it would be rude to interrogate those who seek “treatment” to get “better,” whereas artists and audiences both know that their madness is the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But just to humor myself, I press a bit more on the question of the label’s financial stability. For example, how do his choices of material affect his overhead costs? “There are some things I like about tapes—mostly that they’ll probably last a lot longer than the CD-R….In a lot of ways, I feel like it doesn’t really matter. If we could afford to put everything out on vinyl, we would, but we’re not at that point. Hopefully one day.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Every question from then on became a springboard for some optimistic goal. Mike alludes to upcoming efforts to expand into book projects, one-time art installations, and whatever else he might find worth sharing. The label co-presents the aforementioned monthly DJ night, “Voltage Drop,” at the Legionnaire Saloon in Uptown Oakland. Each party typically features one or two future or upcoming Ratskin-affiliated artists, with a collection of free physical mixtapes available for early bird arrivals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The label itself has ballooned into a planned twenty-album backlog. “There are ten upcoming releases I have confirmed and can announce, and there’s ten I can’t mention just yet.” For a well-established label with multiple paid employees, this isn’t a stretch; for a one-man operation that intentionally takes a loss (with the eventual goal of breaking even, I’m assured), it is an insane amount.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Given this surge in productivity, I questioned an earlier remark he made that the label was guided by an effort to give voice to those who might not always feel comfortable or confident. Had he ever had to actively convince someone to publicize their music?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Well, look—you can’t book everyone, and you can’t release everyone. The label is there as a resource for artists, document works I think should be documented, and push people to do projects they might not feel fit in anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“People like to keep all these secrets in music, and guard their craft, because if you figure out their trick, then they worry that their whole shtick will break down.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“You mean, everyone will realize it’s not that hard, and they can do it too?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, exactly. And that’s good. I mean, I love punk and I love conceptual art, but I also hate punk and I hate conceptual art. I’m just trying to take what’s good out of different artistic movements and…well, archiving is what I’m doing, not even documenting.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At first it doesn’t occur to me what the difference could possibly be. Again, the intentional-yet-intuitive idea comes to mind. Does documenting mean you plan to do it, while archiving is more of a rote act?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In Ratskin’s case, the “archiving” in itself stands out as a deliberate art. At times, he says, it has merely been a matter of a prolific live performer not having access to recording equipment. He calls subsequent relationships a “collaboration,” and it’s in many ways an entry into a deeply connected musical family. Artists on the Ratskin catalogue often cross-promote, tour together, share the stage on local bills&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;On the same desk where he cuts covers for new tapes, he has two final remaining copies of a 10-cassette box set, sealed with a piezoelectric contact microphone, with twenty artists each splitting a side of a five-minute tape. He’s almost done making copies for the final box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The constant work-in-progress, on a lizard-brain good-vibes level, simply feels like a much better deal for both the consumer and the producer, even though he makes a net loss at press time. An economist reading this might shake their head in disbelief—or maybe it’s just aspiring artists’ concerned parents.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;To put it into economic terms, these artists tend not to care if they make a return on capital investments. The transaction itself is the profit. Monetary profit is a far lower priority than the exponentially growing payoff of helping other artists along their way.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;There are some artists for whom he is confident he has done his part to help, and have moved beyond any semblance of “needing him.” Oakland’s blistering, explosive free-jazz duo Black Spirituals was recently praised by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/arts/music/review-black-spirituals-a-duo-that-defies-categories.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, the latter giving a nod to their Ratskin tape &lt;em&gt;Black Interiors&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Everyone should have their own label,” he adds. “All of the bands I was inspired by did just hack-job shows, driving for hours to play to twenty people… If every Ratskin artist could tour and get paid for every show they played, that would be a great thing. I’m just lucky to have so many talented friends, and that’s the only reason I do the label. All the real work is done by the artist, and I’m just here to contextualize this.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though he is modest about this contextualizing, it’s far from insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In person, Mike is never shy about Ratskin’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imposemagazine.com/music/ratskin&quot;&gt;principled efforts&lt;/a&gt; to support marginalized communities. He was reticent at first, in light of my newfound status as “the press” asking questions, to go into detail again. It didn’t take long for him to open up on the subject, though, given that Ratskin explicitly foregrounds black and brown voices in the music scene, many being native to the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It was inevitable, really, two straight white dudes sitting on a couch listening to metal, while the sounds of his black neighborhood and their very different music choices poured in constantly. “Sure, I’m a gentrifier,” he says when I bring up the subject. “I mean, look around you. Of course I’m part of this neighborhood changing. But also, these are my friends. We talk to each other, we hang out, share things, like regular human beings. All it takes to not be a bad gentrifier is, you know, just don’t be a fucking idiot.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Indeed, before the interview began in earnest, we passed around a blunt with some neighbors and shot the shit. We were a bit sluggish and dazed when the interview started. After half an hour or so, it didn’t feel right to close ourselves off like that, so we turned off the music and recording equipment, opened the front door, and rolled another one.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It should be easy to not be a “fucking idiot,” but that doesn’t mean it’s not hard work sometimes. The proof is in the bags under Mike’s eyes. On days when he does contracting work, he gets up before 5 A.M. to cross the Bay Bridge before rush-hour traffic. The irregular hours make it easier to be involved in nightlife on the weekends, and tour across the country for a few weeks at a time. When he’s home, he’s dubbing tapes, booking concerts, or recording music.  The spools keep spinning the tape, spinning over and over to stave off the madness.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto is the epicenter of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley, but it has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Palo-Alto-decides-it-has-too-much-of-a-good-thing-9200819.php&quot;&gt;too many jobs&lt;/a&gt;. That at least is the tenor of the Peninsula city’s civic mood, where a moratorium on new office development coincides with fierce &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/tweets-from-the-front-palo-alto-city-council-coverage/&quot;&gt;controversy over apartments&lt;/a&gt; near Caltrain with less than one parking spot per resident.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Eleven candidates for city council in Palo Alto gathered in the main chambers of city hall for a moderated &lt;a href=&quot;ttp://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2016/09/16/council-candidates-make-their-pitches-at-palo-alto-forum&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; on September 14th, in which infrastructure and fiscal responsibility dominated what generally amounted to a contest of optimism. Liz Kniss is the only sitting councilmember seeking reelection in this cycle. Young or old, incumbent or newcomer, each couched their plans for addressing Palo Alto’s housing and transportation woes in terms of enduring, positive progress.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto native and sitting Planning and Transportation Commission chair &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.votefine.com/&quot;&gt;Adrian Fine&lt;/a&gt; spoke of aiming for a “21st century approach” to transportation, and others joined in his suggestion that Autonomous Vehicles may soon change the paradigm around transportation planning, parking, and traffic. (Fine, a native of Palo Alto, studied city planning at the University of Pennsylvania.) Leonard Ely III, an older candidate, made the further suggestion that the entire Bay Area should consider merging its transit agencies to reduce the cost per person.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto’s ratio of jobs to housing is estimated at 3-to-1, with effectively half of its peak population commuting in and out from increasingly distant places. The city’s housing shortage recently came under national scrutiny after Planning Commissioner Kate Downing publicly announce her departure, opting to raise her high-earning dual-income family in the relatively more affordable city of Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gregtanaka&quot;&gt;Greg Tanaka&lt;/a&gt;, former chair of the Planning Commission, was keen on connecting transportation with the region’s soaring housing costs. He spoke of a need to “minimize impacts through smaller units” and encourage “multiple transportation modalities,” sharing optimistic goals in spite of his hardships as a small business owner struggling to retain rent-burdened employees.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Incumbent Liz Kniss joined others in the forum expressing more caution over the city’s growing pains. “I fear driving down the street one day and seeing only multi-million dollar homes,” Kniss lamented, urging attendees to support more affordable alternatives. (Palo Alto’s median &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zillow.com/palo-alto-ca/home-values/&quot;&gt;home price&lt;/a&gt; is currently $2.4 million.) Referring to the imbalance of office space and housing in the city, Stewart Carl added, “We cannot possibly build that much living space in Palo Alto without compromising our quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Greer Stone, one of the younger candidates, was quick to parry with positive policy goals of greater housing density and improved public transit. “Let’s build housing near jobs,” he said straightforwardly at one point, “to get people out of their cars.” This idea received pushback from Lydia Kou, who called for the construction of more parking garages along with increased VTA bus service.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Curiously, Stone’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greerstone.com/&quot;&gt;campaign website&lt;/a&gt; echoes the concerns of several older candidates. His platform reads, in part: “Overdevelopment threatens the continuing success of our schools, impact on traffic, parkland preservation, pollution, parking, and retail. We must balance the need for additional housing with the concerns of the surrounding neighborhoods and the collateral impact on schools, traffic, pollution, and public services.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Current Planning Commission chair Adrian Fine took the most risk in balancing optimistic policy with cold, hard reality. “I grew up in a compassionate place,” he said when the candidates recounted their favorite aspects of living in Palo Alto. “As our teachers, our nurses, our firefighters find it increasingly hard to live here, we risk losing some of that compassion.” Other candidates were quick to pounce on the negative angle, insisting that their community still retained plenty of compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When I reached Fine by phone, my first question was simply a clarification: what did he mean by compassion?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“My compassionate community was a place where I’d clean my neighbor’s car, or where the man down the street had been my mother’s professor. As we’ve seen a reduction in our income, age, and cultural diversity, while becoming a global center for technological innovation, we’ve lost a lot of that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Fine constantly alluded to a bedrock of principles underlying his campaign, independent of specific policies. “I don’t care about building or not building—the issue is the community values that we share. Issues like diversity, creativity, the environment. If we believe in those, there are some choices we need to make. In order to support a diverse community, we need to have more housing options and we need to invest in transportation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;His answers came as a rapidfire list of concrete ideas bound tightly to platitudes, like hydrogen bonding with oxygen. The conversation became increasingly candid after that.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We need to make sure that future generations can live out and foster those values,” he reiterated. “I graduated with slightly under 400 students from my high school twelve years ago. There’s now about five of us left in Palo Alto. That’s not normal. So it’s not really about the buildings—that’s the last step, actually.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;What, then, did he see as the first steps?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“In Palo Alto, we built the Oregon Expressway, and we have huge parking lots. Now we’re coming to the conclusion that, gosh, we built our city for cars, there’s a huge environmental and social cost to that. We’re out of space for roads in Palo Alto. Do we use existing infill space for cars or for people?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“My fiancée and I don’t own cars,” he added, “and many of our friends don’t. We take Uber or Lyft, we bike, we walk, we take Caltrain. With ridesharing, autonomous cars, and electric vehicles, that’s progress that’s happening &lt;em&gt;right here&lt;/em&gt;. I think we should be a leader in that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I followed up by asking if people were ever shocked to discover that he lived in Palo Alto without a car. As a former carless resident of the area myself, I couldn’t imagine it being easy. “Sometimes—well, no, not really,” Fine said. “I live a five-minute bike ride from the train, from groceries. To some of our seniors, that may not be an option—in some neighborhoods they have less commercial access, which is something we need to work on. In Palo Alto, 8% of trips are done by bike. That’s pretty big—after Davis, Portland, maybe Boulder. Palo Alto is very flat, with great bike boulevards. And there’s Stanford, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Stanford can circumvent local government, and has much broader control over its land. Absent those privileges, Fine sees Palo Alto at a crossroads where it must choose regional cooperation. “The Bay Area is 110 cities, nine counties, 24 transit systems—that’s a really hard region to work in. Given our reality, we’ve got to work overtime.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Many communities are envious of Palo Alto’s success, and our quality of life,” he continued. “I believe we need to maintain that and improve it—in some cases that means change. I’m a proponent of managing change effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In our interview, Fine was passionate and animated, yet spoke with the measured cadence of a well-rehearsed veteran politician. Optimism and tempered outrage strike a careful balance in the city’s political atmosphere. The next forum will be held on September 29th, hosted by neighborhood groups, also in council chambers.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Foster City managed to go from a landfill to a flourishing planned suburb in less than a century. Last night, the city’s Planning Commission debated how exactly that trajectory might continue on a parcel known as “Phase C” on Triton Drive. Developers at the Sares Regis Group hope to receive a rezoning for the area, largely allotted for office space, in order to provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/68-units-proposed-in-foster-city/&quot;&gt;68 townhomes&lt;/a&gt; with a shuttle service to the nearby Caltrain station.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The most vocal members of the Commission voiced concern that rezoning for more housing could slow the city’s commercial growth. The parcel is currently only zoned for 17 residential units. Commissioner and former mayor Richard Wykoff led the charge, arguing that there was “a conflict between downsizing the commercial space and the economic plan.” He strongly favored a compromise suggested by the Planning Department to build a hotel there instead, though no such project has been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While some local business owners did express concern over the loss of commercial space, the majority of local residents generally supported the additional townhomes. Commissioner Noemi Avram seemed more receptive to these views, noting that Foster City is the only locality on the Peninsula to require 20% Below Market Rate units on new construction. Foster City currently only has seven such units, so Phase C would effectively triple the amount of permanently affordable housing within city limits.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco housing advocate Laura Clark, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.growsanfrancisco.org/&quot;&gt;Grow SF&lt;/a&gt;, commented on what she perceived as a markedly tone-deaf atmosphere at the meeting. “The Commission, most prominently voiced by Wykoff, showed no concern for the fact that they are only 68% of the way toward meeting the minimum of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://fostercity.org/departmentsanddivisions/communitydevelopment/Features/upload/HOUSING-ELEMENT-ADOPTED-2-2-2015.pdf&quot;&gt;regional housing obligation&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Last night's meeting was a study session, so no legislative action was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
