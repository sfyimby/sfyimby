				&lt;p&gt;Several high-rise projects have recently overcome significant challenges in the Mid-Market area, whether financial or political, likely due in part to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2015/05/can-s-f-highrises-help-affordable-housing-bay-area.html&quot;&gt;favorable zoning updates&lt;/a&gt;. Among them, a 242-unit market-rate development was able to forge a deal with local activists and the city to provide 68 units of affordable housing and resources for transgender cultural amenities.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco developer Group i announced an agreement with appellants of their 120-foot residential and hotel project at &lt;a href=&quot;http://950-974market.com/&quot;&gt;950-974 Market Street&lt;/a&gt;, between 5th and 6th Streets. It is one of several projects in the Mid-Market / Tenderloin area to make significant efforts to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoodline.com/2017/02/san-francisco-plans-nation-s-first-transgender-cultural-district-in-the-tenderloin&quot;&gt;preserve the neighborhood's LGBTQ history&lt;/a&gt; after facing tireless appeals from Q Foundation director Brian Basinger.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In exchange for the appeal being withdrawn, Group I has agreed “to provide $300,000 in funding to the City to support a TLGB Cultural District, a transgender focused community facility, and transgender focused businesses in the Tenderloin,” according to Group i Project Manager Michelle Lin. The developer will be partnering to provide amenities with the local transgender community non-profit Compton’s Cafeteria.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The project has been significantly downsized from an initial plan for 310 dwelling units, shedding 80 feet off proposed height down its current zoning-compliant height, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.curbed.com/2015/10/5/9914544/big-designed-market-street-complex-downsizes-to-250-units&quot;&gt;due to financing issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The 242-unit building will including dedicated space for the Magic Theater, as well as retail space and non-profit office space. Additionally, Group I will be working with the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD), the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation (TNDC), and Tenderloin Housing Clinic (THC) to provide off-site low- and middle-income housing at 180 Jones Street. Under the agreement, Group I will establish the 180 Jones Affordable Housing Trust Fund with a $14.8 million payment. The developer will then deed the land to MOHCD for the construction of 70 efficiency studio apartments.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.curbed.com/2016/9/23/13036142/1028-market-impact-report-hollywood-billiards&quot;&gt;1028 Market Street&lt;/a&gt;, a 13-story project with 186 planned residential units known as “The Hall” has faced a backlash from the city’s Planning Department for proposing to demolish a “contributing historic resource”-the current building on the parcel dates back to 1907. The current ground floor retail space, which had been vacant for many years after the closure of Hollywood Billiards, is currently in use as a space for pop-up food vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;1028 Market was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hoodline.com/2017/01/the-hall-to-shut-down-at-6th-market-as-new-186-unit-building-gains-approval&quot;&gt;finally approved last week&lt;/a&gt;, and the current cafeteria at The Hall is slated to close later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;East Bay Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Last night, Oakland's Planning Commission &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/08/boston-properties-oakland-tower-temescal-bxp.html&quot;&gt;unanimously approved&lt;/a&gt; a 24-story apartment proposal by San Francisco-based real estate firm Boston Properties adjacent to the MacArthur BART station. The tower on the site's Parcel B will include 10,000 square feet of ground floor retail, and 11% of its 402 residential units will be priced Below Market Rate.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;We heard it before we saw it: the thudding of nails on wood, an undercurrent of basketballs bouncing off asphalt, and the occasional growl of a generator. People had taken over Marcus Garvey Park, a small patch of grass under Grove Shafter Freeway at 36th Street and Martin Luther King, Jr. Way, and begun to build The Village.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;(Marcus Garvey Park has an official name designated by the city that activists encouraged us to ignore.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As far as squats and “intentional communities” go, The Village is one of the most ambitious in Oakland’s history. Just as soon as they brought in tents, activists began building shacks out of donated wood, and planting a garden for vegetables and herbs. As we walked to the central “kitchen” table to deposit our food donations, we walked past wheelbarrows carrying soil from various trenches.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A volunteer gardener at The Village&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In one corner, a large orange tent had been designated as a “recovery center,” where activists planned to bring pro bono medical doctors and traditional non-Western healers alike to tend to homeless residents’ needs. Across the overpass, on the unoccupied half of the park, a city-owned bathroom is littered with used syringes. Representatives of The Village say that bathroom has been in disrepair for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple threats from the city, and nearly constant supervision by the Oakland Police Department, organizers with Feed The People say they intend to prove their grassroots movement can be more effective than city bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Feed The People founder Anita De Asis says she felt compelled to act on one particularly cold morning when she drove from West to East Oakland, seeing the litany of homeless encampments along the way. “I just said, ‘fuck it, I have to do something.’ So I started feeding people with my daughter, and in no time at all, our organization grew and grew.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after numerous instances of Oakland and Berkeley police clearing homeless encampments without providing supportive housing, Feed The People decided to settle in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While the police have posted notices on several mobile homes to vacate the area, the city has otherwise left The Village alone.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We were only able to interview part-time volunteers; all the actual residents, they said, were “out and about.” Out of at least a dozen tents lined up along a footpath, only one briefly rustled with any sign of human movement inside.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;De Asis says The Village is a necessary response to the city’s woefully inadequate homelessness services. “Many of our residents have Section 8 vouchers, but no landlord will take them. The system is aware of these people, but can’t help them. Sometimes people get hotel vouchers for two or three months, and when those vouchers are up, they have nowhere else to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Although the miniature houses are erected on wooden pallets to keep the floors dry, De Asis adds that The Village is by no means a permanent solution. “This is a means of harm reduction,” she says. “This is not the only land we’ll be taking. We hope to inspire others to do what we’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Aside from the Recovery Center currently being assembled, there are also plans to bring electricity to part of the park and provide a hot shower. De Asis says the pratical strength of The Village lies in “working much faster than the city could, at a fraction of the cost.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Several organizers claimed that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision in &lt;a href=&quot;http://harvardlawreview.org/2016/03/statement-of-interest-of-the-united-states-bell-v-city-of-boise/&quot;&gt;Bell v. City of Boise&lt;/a&gt; established precedence for legalized autonomous encampments when adequate public services were lacking. Some also pointed to ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/12/14/civil-rights-groups-sue-caltrans-over-homeless-raids/&quot;&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; against Caltrans raiding a homeless encampment in Berkeley. While the initial plan for Feed The People was to claim adverse possession of the park and lay legal claim on the land in 5 years, De Asis now claims that the area “does not exist on any parcel map. It is owned by no one.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While neither we nor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hoodline.com/2017/01/activists-transform-dog-park-into-village-for-homeless-residents&quot;&gt;Hoodline&lt;/a&gt; were able to verify this claim, we were also unable to confirm which public entity does lay claim to Marcus Garvey Park. The City Administrator’s office informed organizers at The Village that the park is leased by the City of Oakland from Caltrans, which we were also unable to verify.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;One city staff member, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that Caltrans was extremely reluctant to allow any sanctioned encampment under freeway overpasses after numerous deaths caused by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The last time we asked [Caltrans] about a sanctioned encampment under a bridge,” our anonymous source said, “their response basically was, ‘we’ll freaking murder you.’”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Despite the city’s apprehension, De Asis claims that The Village has received support from city employees “going rogue” to help them.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Not only doers the city not care about its citizens in need, they don’t care about their own employees who think this is the right thing to do. The city should listen to its own community—to its own employees—when we say that we can do this better,” De Asis says. “The support from the community has been overwhelming.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When we returned to our vehicle, my photographer and I found its egress blocked by a pickup truck loaded with more pallets. While two OPD officers watched, I helped a volunteer unload some of the remaining pallets onto a pile next to the shacks.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“That one pig,” I overheard a volunteer say, “that’s the guy who arrested me at Occupy.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;It was precisely 3 o’clock in the afternoon on Saturday, January 28th when a wave of humanity poured into the international terminal at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). In response to President Trump’s executive orders on immigration and reports that several immigrant families had been detained at the airport, groups like Resistance SF called upon San Franciscans to rally and demand their release.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The protests began with a few hundred people occupying the sidewalk with a rainbow of signs, and grew as more people joined throughout the day. Lawyers from the ACLU and other legal aid organizations and elected officials such as Senator Scott Wiener and Assemblymember David Chiu joined the fray as the protest spilled onto the street and shut down the terminal. As the evening approached and the crowd almost reached into the thousands, the protesters marched into the terminal, occupying it and demanding the release of detainees.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The angry and combative initial mood of the protest became more festive as the protesters racked up small victories - the release of individual detainees - and became euphoric as the organizers declared that the U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly had ruled in favor of a habeas corpus petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), resulting in a national stay. Local leaders, such as Supervisors London Breed and Jane Kim, joined the protests alongside tech leaders such as Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sunday saw even more massive protests, with several thousand protesters waving signs with messages including“No Bans, No Walls” and “Refugees welcome!” and supporters dropping off piles and piles of snacks and water.When, at 2:47 PM, the SFO Twitter account announced that “the last person detained a SFO by the Executive Order has been released,” protesters remained suspicious, and remained organized until around 7 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The protest in many ways had become a welcoming committee to arrivals at the airport, but the mood remained subdued as organizers packed up and prepared for what the next day would bring in these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;In the wake of a pair of executive orders, protesters gathered last night to protest ongoing plans to build the Dakota Access Pipeline and the KeystoneXL pipeline expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Before sunset, a phalanx of federal Homeland Security police cars and motorcycles outnumbered a half-dozen protesters holding signs for the Standing Rock Sioux in front of the Federal Building on 7th and Mission Street. By nightfall, over one hundred held signs and banners in solidarity with Indigenous peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Corrina Gould, a member of the Ohlone tribe, led the gathering in a prayer as the sweet aroma of burning sage filled the air. As several signature-gatherers wound their way through the crowd, Gould exhorted attendees to support her community’s opposition to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/11/29/berkeley-remains-of-at-least-five-individuals-found-at-project-site-report-says/&quot;&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; on Fourth Street in Berkeley, near an archaeological site where the historic Ohlone Shellmound site is believed to have extended on its northern fringe. The site is currently occupied by a parking lot for Spenger’s Fish Grotto.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The day after the election, I had lunch with an African-American friend who said, ‘this is how people must have felt after Reconstruction,’” Gould told the crowd. “We’ve been here before. We’ve thrived and we’ve survived.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many speakers that followed urged attendees to divest from banks with financial interests in the Dakota Access Pipeline, including Wells Fargo. President Trump and his nominee for Secretary of Commerce Wilbur mentioned s having direct interests in the pipeline with stakes in Energy Transfer Partners. Rick Perry, Trump’s pick for Energy Secretary, sits on the company’s Board of Directors.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While the City of Berkeley resolved this week to divest its finances from Wells Fargo, some spoke of future protests to call on the University of California Board of Regents to make a similar commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Gloria Esteban, a representative of the Mission-based nonprofit Causa Justa, spoke in Soanish through an English translator on the need for an anticolonialist solidarity between all ethnicities in the Bay Area.
“I stand here as a woman of Zapotec descent, and I am not an immigrant. My ancestors walked these lands too,” Esteban said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that all with white skin are responsible,” Esteban went on. “It’s the 1%, those with the blind ambition for power and wealth.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;And it’s up to the rest of us—as other speakers echoed—if we believe in justice, to stand up for it.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Mayor Ed Lee joined Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguín and San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo in vowing to defend “sanctuary city” status in their respective cities. After President Trump signed an executive order to withhold federal funding from cities that do not cooperate with the ICE, many Bay Area activists and politicians redoubled on their commitments to keep local law enforcement from collaborating with deportation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though it is unclear what power, if any, the executive order will have, Bay Area cities are bracing themselves for funding shortfalls. San Francisco receives $1 billion in federal funding; Oakland stands to lose $130 million with Mayor Schaaf expressing particular concern for $18 million in school funding that could now be jeopardized. San Jose’s current budget has $78 million in federal funding.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Our city is still a sanctuary city and we are going to remain a sanctuary city,” Mayor Lee said, reinforcing those marks again today in his State of the City address. San Francisco, as its own county, has far more power to refuse compliance with federal immigration policy. Its Board of Supervisors &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoodline.com/2016/11/board-of-supervisors-resolution-defies-trump-threats-reaffirms-sanctuary-city&quot;&gt;already passed a nonbinding resolution&lt;/a&gt; last year reaffirming its sanctuary city status.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Santa Clara County, however, leads California among counties refusing to hold prisoners for ICE, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/25/editorial-bay-area-cities-are-on-the-right-side-of-immigration-clash/&quot;&gt;according to ICE itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“There’s a broad consensus among major city police chiefs that having local officers meddle in federal immigration enforcement undermines public safety, and diminishes community trust,” San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the Bay Area, the story is different. An East Bay &lt;em&gt;Express&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/ambushed-contra-costa-county-law-enforcement-sets-up-surprise-stings-to-help-federal-immigration-agents-arrest-and-deport-immigrants/Content?oid=5078922&quot;&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; found that the Contra Costa County Sherriff’s Office covertly cooperated with ICE to deport longtime residents previously convicted of petty crimes in what some targets describe as “Kafkaesque” proceedings. On the southern fringes of Alameda county, Assemblywoman Catherine Baker (R – Dublin) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/25/bay-area-mayors-activists-denounce-trumps-push-to-defund-sanctuary-cities/&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Mercury News&lt;/em&gt; that she believed loss of federal funding “absolutely has to be on the table” when noncompliance with deportation proceedings involves convicted violent felons.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;California’s newly-appointed Attorney General Xavier Becerra released a statement yesterday promising to protect all residents in the state from “unwarranted intrusion” from any entity, including federal agencies. “Executive orders cannot contradict existing law,” Becerra added. “And executive orders can be challenged for violating constitutional and legal standards in their enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;During yesterday’s San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting, Supervisor Mark Farrell (District 2, Marina / Cow Hollow) announced plans to tighten regulations on affordable housing funds. Specifically, the ordinance will aim to prevent the use of public funds for anything other than “unrelated to the creation, development, or preservation of affordable housing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Farrell’s proposal comes in the wake of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/tenants-in-todco-property-allege-abuse-neglect-and-intimidation/&quot;&gt;revelations&lt;/a&gt; that John Elberling, Director of the nonprofit development firm TODCO, funneled equity gains from properties originally funded by federal grants to sponsor political campaigns, such as the successful Proposition C ballot measure in 2016. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/tenants-in-todco-property-allege-abuse-neglect-and-intimidation/&quot;&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; by this publication found significant neglect of properties and tenant intimidation in a property built by TODCO and managed by the John Stewart Company.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The majority of affordable housing developers are good actors, but we’re in a housing crisis,” Farrell wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@MarkFarrellSF/press-release-supervisor-farrell-aims-to-steer-developers-profits-toward-affordable-housing-4b2d813b7b37#.e1abnbja3&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We must ensure that every penny available for affordable housing is being used for affordable housing needs.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The ordinance would require further oversight on behalaf of the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) to ensure that excess proceeds are only directed toward capital improvement, operating costs, or the acquisition / construction of new affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In response to questions about specific implementation plans, Farrell’s staff wrote in an email: “MOHCD requires some of this already to a certain effect administratively, but our legislation makes sure that the practice is codified moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mr. Elberling has yet to respond to repeated requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Mountain View renters clinched a major victory in their municipal legislature last night when the City Council voted unanimously to defend a rent control measure.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/mountain-view-tenants-rally-to-defend-rent-control-measure/&quot;&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt;, Mountain View’s City Council had voted in a closed session to comply with a restraining order against the recently-passed Measure V, filed by the California Apartment Association, a statewide real-estate lobbying group. In another vote behind closed doors yesterday, the council approved a resolution to defend Measure V against any litigation by the CAA. The decision was preceded b y a small rally outside of City Hall by the Mountain View Tenants Coalition, a grassroots organization that campaigned to pass the measure.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While the council was largely reluctant to support Measure V during election season, former mayor Pat Showalter had offered positive comments, despite his reservations that passing rent control as a charter amendment was too extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Current Mayor Ken Rosenberg informed the Tenants Coalition that his office had been flooded with a record number of emails urging city officials to support Measure V.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;MVTC published excerpts from emails sent to city officials, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The City Council's decision to agree to a temporary restraining order against Measure V is costing our family $575 every month. As of April 1, it will start costing us $775 every month. We have been trying to save up for a house for years. With the rent increases over the recent years it's harder and harder to make progress toward that down payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“This is a big victory,” Daniel DeBolt, of MVTC, wrote in an email. “The city is now going to put its considerable resources towards the legal defense of a rent control law that all but one council member opposed. In the end, the council decided to honor the wishes of voters. We are all very relieved.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;In an occasionally tense special meeting last night, Oakland’s City Council voted unanimously to delay any decision on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/23/oakland-warehouse-fire-tenant-protection-ordinance-proposed-as-artists-evicted/&quot;&gt;Emergency Tenant Protection Ordinance&lt;/a&gt; proposed by the Oakland Warehouse Coalition. In the wake of the fatal Ghost Ship fire, OWC has requested a 180-day moratorium on evictions, particularly “red-tagging” evictions caused by a lack of building code compliance. Among other policies, the Coalition is requesting that the city extend Just Cause eviction protections to residents in unpermitted properties.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;City Council approved a motion by Councilmember-at-large Rebecca Kaplan to request documents from the City Attorney comparing OWC’s ordinance with Mayor Libby Schaaf’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2017/01/12/oakland-mayor-libby-schaaf-issues-executive-order.html&quot;&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt;, which lacks an eviction moratorium.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many speakers urged the Council to approve the Emergency Ordinance immediately, describing the artistic community as a “backbone” of the city’s culture facing immediate peril.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Let this be a Rennaisance, not just for rich people, but for everyone,” said one speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Another speaker noted that Oakland’s intergenerational culture was a unique asset that the city should preserve with extraordinary “out-of-the-box thinking” policies. “Victims in the fire were ages 17 to 61,” she said. “There are almost no other cities where different generations hang out together, share ideas, party together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I’m a violinist and an artist, and I also work in tech,” said one visibly distressed speaker supporting OWC’s ordinance. “As a… ‘techie’… I feel a lot of guilt over the displacement going on. But for myself, and many others I work with, we didn’t move here just for a job. We moved here to be a part of the culture.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;An eerie silence fell over the audience as she went on: “I don’t want to live in a city where everyone works in tech, just like me. Who wants to live somewhere without different conversations going on all around you? That would be so boring. We need all sorts of people to make this community thrive.” Her comment was met with muted applause.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In a particularly emotional moment, Micah Allison, partner of the Ghost Ship’s master tenant Derick Almena (who is under criminal investigation) spoke of facing ostracism from the community. “I just want to say that I am deeply sorry for what happened,” she said. “We carry a really heavy weight on our shoulders now.” She related her family’s struggle in finding a new home to rent, and of wanting to keep her children in East Oakland public schools, to a loud applause from the public.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Several landlords spoke, to varying reactions from the public, about liability concerns the Ordinance would impose on them. One man confessed that he had several friends living in an unpermitted warehouse space that he owned. “I look forward to working with the city on this,” he said, “but I’m a father. I work to support my kids. If something happens during these 180 days, I would be personally liable. I can’t afford that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;City Council did approve several uncontroversial measures: one to mark December 2nd as Ghost Ship Remembrance Day, and an ordinance by Councilmember Kaplan to amend the Code Enforcement Relocation Program to extend relocation payments to tenants in live-work spaces, regardless of residential permitting.&lt;/p&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;State Senator Scott Wiener (D – San Francisco) &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Scott_Wiener/housing-for-a-growing-california-details-on-my-housing-reform-bill-e22dfff855e0?source=linkShare-5a2e5d91f709-1485186417&quot;&gt;announced further details&lt;/a&gt; today on SB-35, his proposed “Housing Accountability and Affordability Act.” The bill aims to streamline and incentivize infill housing development to ease the state’s housing shortage, and mend the flaws that stalled similar efforts by Governor Jerry Brown last summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Central to Wiener’s proposal is enabling California to enforce compliance with individual cities’ Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA), which the state’s Office of Housing and Community Development (HCD) measures every eight years but has little power to turn into reality. SB-35 would compel cities to submit reports on housing built toward their RHNA goals every two years, and establish as-of-right approval procedures if the city is found to be short of its allotted goals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The streamlining applies only to the income levels that aren’t being built for,” Wiener wrote in a press release; “so if a city is building sufficient market-rate units but not enough low-income units, the project must add low-income units to qualify for streamlined approval.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Cities will only retain local control over residential construction permitting once they meet their goals for all income categories. Further, charter cities will be required to submit annual reports on housing production.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Local control must be about how a community meets its housing goals, not whether it meets those goals. Too many communities either ignore their housing goals or set up processes designed to impede housing creation,” Wiener’s office added in a fact sheet. “Allowing local communities to ignore their responsibility to create housing has led to a housing disaster — triggering huge economic, environmental, and social problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Brian Hanlon, founder of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlaef.org&quot;&gt;California Renters Advocacy and Legal Aid Fund&lt;/a&gt; (CaRLA), was ecstatic over the announcement. Hanlon’s group, a 501(c)3 non-profit, raises money in part to fund litigation against cities that violate state law in their aversion to new housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“SB 35 is an important step to make California's 48 year old Housing Element Law enforceable,” Hanlon wrote in an email. However, he was also cautious in noting that cities could still find ways to circumvent the enforcement mechanisms underlying Wiener’s bill.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I urge Sen. Wiener to work with housing development feasibility analysts to ensure that his proposed streamlining measures will meaningfully expedite housing production. I also urge the Legislature to limit housing development fees and conditions to a feasible level. Streamlining the entitlement process matters little if localities levy cost-prohibitive fees and conditions to build homes.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The popular term IDM, for “Intelligent Dance Music,” presupposes that simplicity of form is inherently dumb, or at least of lesser intelligence. But we all know that’s bullshit. The Oakland DJ collective Club Chai knows there’s zero correlation between complexity and depth, and they seem to exploit the very falseness of that dichotomy into a wild success—not to mention a treat for the listener/dancer.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Club Chai’s new mixtape &lt;em&gt;Club Chai Vol. 1&lt;/em&gt; culls the best material from their sweaty, all-night sceances at the altar of Rhythm Itself. Founded by Oakland artists Foozool and 8ULETINA, the collective’s shows and accompanying mixtape center female and trans voices in a “diasporic” cross-cut of Bay Area. It’s hard to believe they’re just celebrating their first year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It’s not the intricacy so much as the, shall we say, intimacy that makes the collective’s unique sound so magical. You instantly feel a familiar pulse, evoking some primordial collective memory that you can never quite place. Stellar tracks like Nargiz’s “ooW No More” could find its way into a dance party of Syrian dabke, reggaeton, cumbia, or Western Sahel disco, or any Oakland club’s hip hop night. The Creatrix, who has been lighting up many a techno night in San Francisco over the past year, takes us through an airy, melancholy whirl before pummeling the listener with throbbing, industrial sub-bass tones.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Any pair of the 21 tracks could present an equally rich study in contrasts; I just happened to pick those two.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Any Club Chai artist is one not to be missed, the cream of the crop in the Bay Area’s heavily saturated dance subcultures. If, like myself, you lack the thighs and hips of steel to assiduously chase down every single one of their late-night sets, this mixtape will do quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Club Chai will be hosting a &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; live showcase to mark this milestone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/1234718039941655/&quot;&gt;tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; at the Starline Social Club featuring Xuxa Santamaria, Fela Kutchii, Spellling, Jasmine Infiniti, and Lak, with 8ULENTINA and Foozool headlining.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;On a rainy, gusty day in Berkeley, the city’s homeless residents huddled in alleyways, under tarps and in tents, struggling to withstand elements. During last week’s stormy nights, a homeless woman &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/01/15/body-homeless-woman-found-near-berkeley-high/&quot;&gt;died of exposure&lt;/a&gt;  one block from city hall.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As I walked past Berkeley High, I spotted a group of tourists gawking at an alien-like metal cuboid parked beside the curb that I recognized at once: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/tiny-houses-huge-hurdles-panoramic-and-the-future-of-supportive-housing/&quot;&gt;MicroPAD&lt;/a&gt; had arrived at last.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Far from an extraterrestrial spacecraft, Panoramic Interests’ 160 square foot modular studio home is designed to bring the costs of supportive housing further down to earth. Berkeley’s City Council will consider a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityofberkeley.info/Clerk/City_Council/2017/01_Jan/Documents/2017-01-24_Item_35_Referral_to_City_Manager_Step_Up.aspx&quot;&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, January 24, directing staff to research potential collaboration with the private developer known for modular or prefabricated projects across the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Panoramic advertises their prefabricated design, shipped from a Chinese factory, as costing only 40% of “traditional” brick-and-mortar construction. Owner and Director &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2012/12/21/patrick-kennedy-owner-of-panoramic.html&quot;&gt;Patrick Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; added in an interview, “it’s cheaper to bring them over on a ship from China than drive one over on a truck from Sacramento. That’s how much you save when buying in bulk.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kennedy hopes to strike a deal with the city for Panoramic to build apartments with potentially hundreds of MicroPADs on city-owned land, with the units leased below market value (Kennedy estimates $1,000 compared to $1,400) to house its burgeoning homeless population. The units can essentially be “stacked” into full apartments, with a ground floor for services, in six to eight months. After fifteen years, Berkeley could make an offer to buy the buildings from Panoramic.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“These tiny houses they’ve displayed in places like Portland don’t have all the infrastructure you need for supportive housing,” Kennedy says. “With [the MicroPAD], you have all wiring, plumbing, and fire code already there, and you don’t need really as much land. The city pays less to house more people in better conditions. The way we see it, we’re a one-trick pony, but we’re the only pony around that does this trick.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MicroPAD interior view (courtesy: Panoramic Interests)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Panoramic’s tour guide, who detailed the sample unit’s amenities to us along with a Berkeley High School teacher and a homeless man, said that they also hope to be able to help the city save costs in health and public safety resulting from its current crisis of homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The “Step-Up Housing Initiative” is sponsored by Councilmembers Linda Maio, Lori Droste, and the newly-elected Ben Bartlett. Bartlett, representing South Berkeley, ran on a firmly positive, optimistic platform that included plans to build at last 600 backyard Accessory Dwelling Units. His successful campaign wasn’t even the most successful in a double-digit sweep by the city’s nominally “progressive” faction of Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I’m always looking out for innovative ideas,” Councilmember Bartlett said in a phone interview. “An activist friend in Los Angeles showed [the MicroPAD] to me over a year ago, and I sought out the developer. It’s really simple to me. I saw an outcome, and I saw a mechanism to make it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Bartlett repeatedly stressed that he was impressed by the cost-effectiveness Panoramic offered in potentially alleviating an emergent crisis. He also expressed surprise and dismay that there had been heated criticism to Panoramic in some local political circles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been surprised by some of the negative reactions. I guess because I’m new, maybe I have a fresh perspective, I don’t understand what the problem is,” he said of those criticisms. “For me, the messenger is not the medium. As an African-American, as a member of the population that has been challenged from the get-go—when it comes to solutions for economic inclusion, civic inclusion, and human well-being, I focus on the outcome. When it comes to moving a person forward to a better life, I’m about getting it done. Here, I was attracted by the affordability from the city’s standpoint, and the speed. We have 1,200 homeless people—conceivably, we could have one tenth of them housed in 6 months for $1,200,000 a year.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“An overemphasis on process, to the detriment of outcome, has us in the problem we’re in,” Bartlett added. “I’m not about personality politics, and it’s not what we need in the midst of a homelessness crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Insiders have told the &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; that there is wild speculation over how MicroPAD will play out among the new majority. Councilmember Sophie Hahn, another candidate from the &quot;progressive&quot; bloc who just as deftly swept the District 5 election, was strenuously opposed to previous “micro-unit” proposals during her time on the Zoning Adjustments Board (ZAB). In 2013, Hahn joined a majority on the ZAB in opposing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2013/08/20/berkeley-neighbors-fight-micro-unit-proposal-on-shattuck/&quot;&gt;five-story apartment proposal&lt;/a&gt; on Shattuck Avenue and Derby Street with 70 micro-units. During the hearing, Hahn expressed disapproval of the overall concept of micro-units, which she described as “penitentiary housing” lacking enough room for exercise or “intimacy.” Two years later, Hahn also voted with a majority to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/11/19/berkeley-zab-round-up-the-roost-approved-on-blake-center-street-hotel-previewed-kennedy-project-put-off/&quot;&gt;postpone action&lt;/a&gt; on a project by Panoramic Interests with 22 micro-units one block away.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The homeless man touring the MicroPAD with us, a Laney College student who identified himself as Derek, said the room was “beautiful” and planned to support it. He mentioned that he has almost completed his degree program. “It’s pretty pathetic, you know,” he said to the tour guide, “people are always presenting these big plans on paper, but they’ll never get around to decide how to spend the money on something. They should just sit down and do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Derick eagerly took an informational pamphlet, along with a copy of next week’s city council meeting agenda, from the spotless plastic counter.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We shook hands, wished each other a good day, and walked off separately into the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Alameda’s City Council meeting covered a dizzying variety of issues last night—among other notable actions, the city affirmed its status as a sanctuary city. Over the objections of a handful of older residents, the Council largely supported the efforts of several dozen demonstrators urging the city to draft a more specific resolution to protect the civil rights of migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;More subtly, but perhaps just as importantly, the City Council also united to support an ambitious mixed-use development on Alameda Point known as Site A. With a full 25% of the 800 units indexed at Below Market Rate rents, Site A is one of the Bay Area’s largest municipal efforts to tackle the regional housing shortage on mostly vacant land. It is here that the &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; will focus its coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The decision focused on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cityofalameda1.app.box.com/s/sgx1v3j9qp5b4zvk6tg990dhffpo4lkq&quot;&gt;Disposition and Development Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (DDA) between the city and Alameda Point Partners, LLC. The developer sought a three-month extension on its financing deadline to secure further funds for infrastructure. The 68-acre site, part of the former Naval Air Base, is not well-served by transit. The city estimated infrastructure costs for the project as up to $40 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“This is just a development deal to finance infrastructure. Once we fund the infrastructure, a land development deal to finance infrastructure is through developer equity,” a city staffer explained, more for the public’s benefit than to educate elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Staff underscored that Site A is a “very complicated project” and that the developer had been “working very hard…on an aggressive timeline.” Though it was often noted that Alameda Point Partners had raised more funds in the month since the previous deadline had passed in December, the five-member council seemed to have already made up its mind. Mayor Trish Spencer repeatedly voiced her opposition to granting the extension, while the rest of the council supported it as a matter of “now or never.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Existing businesses on Alameda Point really need this infrastructure,” said Michael McDonough, President of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. “The delay should be pushed through with approval, because we’ll still be getting the project we’ve wanted for twenty years,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;project plan for Site A (source: City of Alameda)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Helen Sause of the Alameda Home Team testified, “It’s pretty exceptional for a developer to make serious efforts to meet with the community this much,” describing a litany of meetings in which the developer discussed and revised project design with the input of neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Delaying this now puts us in a position where it may never happen,” said local Alameda resident Philip James, recently elected as Assembly District Delegate to the state’s Democratic Party. “We have the ball rolling on a chance to turn a piece of land that has provided no benefit to Alameda—almost blighting it—into something positive.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Several Alamedans, however, shared Mayor Spencer’s reservations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The lack of funding should be a point of concern to this council,” one woman testified. “A project of this size should have many sources of funding.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Another woman said she had scoured the developer’s website and found that they catered to a “luxury apartment” market, and questioned whether the developer’s plan was to create “a gated community without a gate.” (Alameda currently has a median home price of $880,000, according to Zillow.)
“Most of all adults living in Site A will not be working here…they will not be a part of the community, but one of their own, and we will be left like children on the outside looking in,” she went on in requesting that the council deny approval.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;One man urged the council to consider local development alternatives controlled by nearby residents. “One suggestion we have is a raised foundation,” he said. “Alameda Point is susceptible to sea-level rise.”
“The infrastructure isn’t just paid for in good wishes,” Councilmember Marilyn Ezzy Ashcraft noted. “This developer is making 25% of all units affordable.” She went on to urge the council to “keep the faith and not get cold feet.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“This developer &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; returning phone calls, they’re working with financers who aren’t as shady as they’ve been before,” said Councilmember Jim Oddie. “So I’m confident that this will work out…The leash is short,” he added. “The bottom line is, in order to build affordable housing, you have to have market-rate.” By comparison, he described the $22 million the city sought to finance subsidized housing as showing needs far above what public dollars could finance, given a recent $7 million apportionment from the countywide housing bond (2016’s Measure AA).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“This is the greatest amount of affordable housing we’ve ever seen proposed here,” said Councilmember Frank Mataresse. In his view, the risk of a future default was much lower than the present risk of the entire project collapsing from lack of financing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Vice Mayor Malia Vella joined in the majority approving the delay, cautioning that she would be much more reluctant to support such an action the second time. “We’ve been burned before,” she said, “but in this scenario, the developer has shown a lot of good will.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;By a vote of 4-1, Alameda Point Partners received their requested three-month extension&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Sandy Buschman left San Francisco a year ago to open a bar in Puerto Rico. La Boveda, in San Juan’s Viejo San Juan district, hosts weekly experimental concerts largely of the same noisy, challenging nature that Sandy brought to the Bay Area. We really want her back.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;So much so, in fact, that Mission-based music non-profit collective &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelab.org/&quot;&gt;The Lab&lt;/a&gt; paid to fly her back for a one-of-a-kind (okay, four total) party on a boat cruise around the San Francisco Bay. Reunited with Oakland-via-Venezuela artist Danishta Rivera in the duo Las Sucias, Buschman formed part of a floating statement dubbed “Attention: We’ve Moved,” organized by artist and emcee Constance Hockaday to innovative artists who have left the Bay Area for greener pastures.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“They flew me out, they’re paying us well, and look at this,” Buschman said, gesturing to the enormous, golden full moon cresting over the Oakland hills. “I couldn’t have asked for more.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Las Sucias’ noisy, abrasive, feminist deconstruction of reggaeton was followed by the thoroughly disorienting light-sound synthesis of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mshr.info/index.html&quot;&gt;MSHR&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “mesher”). The pair of seizure-immune engineers Birch Cooper and Brenna Murphy recently relocated to Portland (pictured in the cover photo above), but their blinding performance of sound-emitting light fixtures felt perfectly at home in the bay’s freaky music scene. What didn’t feel quite so familiar, of course, was holding back the seasickness as their stabbing multisensory oscillations synchronized with the swaying of the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia and nausea never felt quite so enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Dennis Richards (pictured above), acting president of the San Francisco Planning Commission, told a pair of French nuns, “I’ll even try your food,” before moving to approve their application for a use permit to run a non-profit soup kitchen out of vacant retail space. “You can donate, too,” one Sister replied.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I’ll come volunteer,” Richards added without missing a beat.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Thus concluded the first, heartwarming half of the Planning Commission’s Discretionary Review agenda yesterday. The stars were aligned: Tony Robbins, celebrity business consultant, had partnered with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff to donate a new space, located at 1928 Mission Street, to the Fraternite Notre Dame Mary of Nazareth House, after the landlord of their soup kitchen at 54 Turk Street moved to evict the nuns. Both Robbins and Benioff testified in favor. Newly sworn-in District 9 Supervisor Hillary Ronen brought droves of local supporters to the meeting, saying it was the most “compassionate, appropriate service to come to the Mission.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Several neighbors from the 1930 Mission Street condominiums above the storefront came out to oppose the use permit, citing safety concerns. One man stated, after a litany of supporting testimonies, that although he still felt “this is just not the right place,” he would still be open to it being “very nearby.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Estimated sale prices for the condos at 1930 Mission Street range from $800 to $1200 per square foot. Property tax assessments in the building were, on average, roughly half of their market value. The vacant storefront and condominiums also share the building with a medical marijuana office.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Another resident of 1930 Mission, a visibly younger woman sporting dyed blue hair (pictured above), had already spoken in support of the soup kitchen, mostly anticipating the man’s later rebuttals. “This will make the area safer,” she said. She was one among many nearby residents who insisted that alleviating the hunger of local homeless population would positively impact their daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The mood was not as cheerful when the meeting’s Discretionary Review portion turned to a five-story mixed-use proposal with 28 dwelling units and ground-floor retail at 198 Valencia Street.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A nearby decades-old beer garden, Zeitgeist, had complained publicly for weeks prior that the proposed apartment building would cast shadows over their outdoor patio and drive away customers. Although the city typically does not study shadows for space on private property, appellants from the bar brought a shadow impact analysis that did not follow officially mandated methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I would like to see more granular data here,” Commissioner Richards told the Zeitgeist representatives. “I feel for you guys, I really do, but right now I just don’t see it.” Zeitgeist claimed the building would shade 7% of their patio after 4pm between March and May, and from August to September. (Planning Department staff argued that a 4% estimate was more likely under their methodology.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;One man who had been working at Zeitgeist for 13 years testified, “without the sunshine, we would no longer be Zeitgeist.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The project at 198 Valencia would be replacing a one-story automobile oil changing station, which drea concern from Peter Pappadopolous of the non-profit Cultural Action Network. “We're concerned about the loss of another auto shop,” he said. “The city has been losing many of its auto repair shops to housing in recent years.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Yet many speakers were more forceful in their support for the project than a mere “I just don’t see it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Think of if the other way around—would we consider removing 28 homes if this place wanted more sunshine?” asked Sonja Trauss, webmaster of this publication. “Of course not.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We shouldn't allow special interests to obstruct the construction of housing and inflation of property values,” one man said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Multiple speakers also mentioned California’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;amp;sectionNum=65589.5&quot;&gt;Housing Accountability Act&lt;/a&gt;, which requires cities to approve housing developments that meet local zoning requirements in the absence of a quantified health or environmental detriments. For this reason, the alternate option of removing ground-floor retail to include more residential units was quickly dismissed, since the building could still legally rise to 50 feet. (Under the current proposal, an additional five-foot “parapet” is allowed.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supporters and opponents alike will have to wait over a month to see if any detriment can be quantified. The commission voted 5-1 to continue the item until their February 16th meeting, pending another study of shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A coalition of neighbors in San Mateo County dubbed “Redwood City Residents for Responsible Development” (RCRFRD) successfully leveraged environmental litigation to downsize new development in the downtown area. The developer, Jefferson Res, LLC, submitted applications for a permit in September 2015 for an 8-story condominium building with 91 dwelling units at 603 Jefferson Avenue. After approving it in May of 2016, the City Council voted to deny an appeal brought by two residents in late July.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Following the settlement of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55dbb5e9e4b0703ec759c956/t/587697f320099e396b9c5553/1484167439462/Redwood+City+-+603+Jefferson+-+Suit.pdf&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; brought under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the developer agreed to shorten the project to 6 stories, comprising only 68 units.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies from the law firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hklaw.com/news/holland-knight-study-uncovers-widespread-ceqa-litigation-abuse-08-04-2015/&quot;&gt;Holland &amp;amp; Knight&lt;/a&gt; have shown that the majority of CEQA lawsuits target public transit, renewable energy, and infill housing development. The appellants alleged “severe” impacts on traffic in their suit, relying on a Level Of Service (LOS) measure for traffic impacts which California lawmakers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opr.ca.gov/docs/SB_743_CEQA_Guidelines_Update_Local_Government_Roundtable_8_18_14.pdf&quot;&gt;have begun phasing out&lt;/a&gt;, instead quantifying traffic impact in terms of Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Isabelle Chu, founder of the non-profit advocacy group &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redwoodcityforward.com/&quot;&gt;Redwood City Forward&lt;/a&gt;, was deeply disappointed by the outcome of the lawsuit. “If these [developments] were deeply unpopular, we’ve had ample opportunity to vote out our current city council. That has not happened,” she said in a brief phone interview. “Judging from the actions and voting patterns, the city of Redwood City likes the downtown, or at least doesn’t object to it. Consequently, these actions are overriding the will of everyone who elected the city council; everybody who gave input into the Downtown Specific Plan; and everyone who lives, works, and visits the downtown.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ms. Chu reserved particular ire for the grounds on which the suit was filed. “It’s based on an outdated measure [LOS] which indicates that their primary concern is not, in fact, the environment, but rather the convenience of their drive. First of all, the primary determinant of traffic is the economy, not housing,” she added.  “Housing near jobs reduces traffic, all things being equal. Traffic is an inconvenience. Housing is a basic necessity. To deny somebody a place to life because you’re inconvenienced is unjust.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Brian Hanlon, founder of the California Renters Legal Advocacy and Education Fund (CaRLA), sees the lawsuit as part of a broader pattern of abusing environmental litigation to maintain suburban sprawl. “Local NIMBYs should not be able to use CEQA to compel a reduction of 23 homes in a downtown development,” Mr. Hanlon wrote in an email. “The claim that building an 8-story residential building would cause ‘severe significant environmental impacts’ is absurd.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In the event that plaintiffs lose their case, an unincorporated club can easily avoid liability for damages or attorney’s fees. (Holland &amp;amp; Knight researchers recommend reforming this aspect of the law, requiring litigants to state their full names to deter CEQA abuse.) Consequently, the plaintiffs could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco is perpetually a city of rising stars, but conventional wisdom dictates that once they rise, they must flee for Los Angeles with all deliberate haste. SF Sketchfest has established itself as a global institution to counter the tinsel-town dominance of show business, pushing the envelope with new and innovative comedians alongside the star power of established stalwarts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself staring at a list of obscure names, don’t worry—it’s as much of a celebration for twisted comedy nerds as it is a festival rife with conventional punchline structures for the casual consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Whether casual or obsessive, you would do yourself a huge disservice to stick to the standup shows, as improv is arguably just as crucial in the chemistry of comedy. That’s why the almost-daily improv showcase at PianoFight is absolutely essential for those seeking a deep dive into the most unpredictable form of comedy available. Of particular note is the showcase on Thursday, January 19th, hosted by the local clothing-optional sketch comedy troupe &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfsketchfest2017.sched.com/artist/chardonnay.1vyfjsd0&quot;&gt;Chardonnay&lt;/a&gt;. (Yes, we recommend them because &lt;em&gt;they are funny,&lt;/em&gt; okay? Get your head out of the gutter.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;On that same night, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfsketchfest2017.sched.com/event/8wLz/sf-sketchfest-nightlife-at-the-california-academy-of-sciences?iframe=no&amp;amp;w=100%&amp;amp;sidebar=yes&amp;amp;bg=no&quot;&gt;California Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; will host an adults-only extravaganza with a live performance by “scientists” Frank Beaulieu and Frank Conniff of Mystery Science Theater 3000, live DJs, alcoholic beverages, and satirical TED Talks, among other weird offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the avant-garde, San Francisco plays second fiddle to no one. It will be especially delightful to the most curious comedy-seekers to see Ian Abramson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfsketchfest2017.sched.com/event/8wMm/7-minutes-in-purgatory-with-ian-abramson-and-guests-alex-jude-joel-kim-booster-dave-hill-joyelle-nicole-johnson-seaton-smith-brent-weinbach-ahamed-weinberg-and-alice-wetterlund?iframe=no&amp;amp;w=100%&amp;amp;sidebar=yes&amp;amp;bg=no&quot;&gt;7 Minutes of Purgatory&lt;/a&gt;, which debuts this Friday, 8:00pm at the Eureka Theater. Abramson encloses comedians in a soundproof booth, where they perform for an audience in a separate room via closed-circuit television. It’s a disorienting experience for both audience and performer, robbed of their symbiotic relationship, often to hilarious effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Our fair city of Saint Francis can no longer be mistaken for a provincial backwater town—not with an international standup showcase featuring award-winning commedians Aisling Bea and James Acaster, from Ireland and New Zealand, respectively. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfsketchfest2017.sched.com/event/8wLl/international-standup-spotlight-aisling-bea-and-james-acaster-hosted-by-josh-johnson?iframe=no&amp;amp;w=100%&amp;amp;sidebar=yes&amp;amp;bg=no&quot;&gt;Friday, January 20th at the Brava Theater&lt;/a&gt;, showgoers can treat themselves to unfamiliar comedy delivered by strangely-accented yet masterful performers whose sense of humor is never lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;What delights us most, frankly, is that readers could ignore all our suggestions and would still be guaranteed a great time. Ultimately, SF Sketchfest is simply a celebration of human speech and movement. Nobody really knows why we enjoy laughter so much, but we’re more than happy to suspend our disbelief and leave our jaded cynicism at coat-check.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Alameda’s Planning Board convened in council chambers to review the &lt;a href=&quot;https://laurendo.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/wade-in-the-waterfront/&quot;&gt;Encinal Terminals Master Plan&lt;/a&gt;, an ambitious proposal on the island’s waterfront facing Oakland. What proceeded was a spectacle most unusual in the Bay Area: a municipal public hearing in which virtually every attendee enthusiastically supported greater density.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Across the estuary, Oakland will be building up to 30 stories at the Brooklyn Basin,” one speaker noted. “So I think fourteen stories might not even be tall enough to fit the surrounding area.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The planning board generally concurred with this observation, commenting approvingly on the varying heights and “stepped-back” massing on the waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The current proposal comprises 589 dwelling units, ranging from 2-story townhomes to the aforementioned 14-story apartment building. It would also include a marina for boat rentals, three acres of open space for recreation, and over 50,000 square feet of commercial space for restaurants and retail.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary site plan for Encinal Terminals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;One speaker expressed enthusiasm for the possibility of commuting across the estuary via kayak, but noted that Oakland and Alameda would have to adopt “kayak parking” infrastructure similar to Minneapolis. Board Member Lorre Zuppan also urged the developer, North Waterfront Cove, LLC, to consider building parking that could be adapted to other uses in the future, given the surge in ride-hailing services and generational decline in car ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://alameda.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2914505&amp;amp;GUID=B0CB5B38-F5C8-4D18-A0B9-E495A5230B59&amp;amp;Options=&amp;amp;Search=&amp;amp;FullText=1&quot;&gt;staff report&lt;/a&gt; indicates that after the city rezoned the area from manufacturing to mixed-use, it remained vacant since 2010. Indeed, one speaker referred to the current site as “grey-field,” and several board members referenced the prevalence of bird droppings during a recent visit.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Philip James, an Alameda resident, further clarified his support for the project: “We have a chance to turn a piece of land that's mostly inaccessible to the public into a public good, and that's a chance we should take,” James wrote in an email. “The one concern I have is for affordable housing - I wish there were more of it! Beyond that, I hope this project is successful, and helps Alameda families grow.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Angela Hockabout, founder of the Alameda Renters Coalition, was even more unequivocal in her support. “The Encinal Terminal development has the potential to send a message to every Bay Area suburb that even development-adverse communities can build the dense neighborhoods we need to solve this housing crisis,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The only way we are going to mitigate the housing crisis is to build up,” Hockabout added.  “California needs to build 1.8 million homes by 2025 and I intend to see each and every one of those units built.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared in&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baycitybeacon.com&quot;&gt;The Bay City Beacon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Coming from nearly 8 years on the San Francisco School Board, Sandra Lee Fewer joins a number of elected officials (Jane Kim, Eric Mar, Norman Yee) that have jumped from the School Board to the Board of Supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A fourth generation native and Chinese American, Sandra Lee Fewer campaigned as a long-time Richmond District local with strong ties to the progressive wing of San Francisco politics. She supported limited growth and opposed the Geary Bus Rapid Transit, and held the sole endorsement of the SF Tenants Union.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview below has been edited for clarity and brevity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your priorities for the first term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;My priorities are to take care of issues in my district. One is to look for three places that build 100% affordable housing, another thing is to take care of some of my issues in my neighborhood such as like the quality of life, street repairs.  What I’ve heard on the campaign was a lot of quality of life issues that my neighborhood needs a little love. So I think that I would start with that - before I was elected I started on a dog park in GGP, I think I want to finish that.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I also want to work on some of the transit issues in the Richmond district, and it really is on the quality of life issues. What I heard loud and clear is that people feel like the Richmond does not get as much service as we should and we are literally neglected on the west side. I think it would take a while to get up to speed on everything and after that I hope to advocate for my neighborhood to get some of these remedies.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any immediate pieces of legislation you’re thinking about introducing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;No, I feel like the first six months I am going to learn, take it slow, see how things are, see how things are run, who the people are, and really get out in my neighborhood and meet the community groups throughout my neighborhood and listen. I think the first six months I am planning to do a lot of listening and to see what kind of issues citywide or in my district I should be offering.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me your thoughts about how the election went this year for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sure, I think the election was very difficult, in January I pulled papers to run.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I was sort of a reluctant candidate, I am a little older and didn’t think I be doing this in my life. But I think once I pulled papers we were boasting ahead, we were working very hard and I think we worked really hard till the last vote had been cast on Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;There were 10 candidates that ran in this race and I learned from every single one of them. All these candidate forums, you start to listen to everyone’s ideas and their feelings about the neighborhood, and since they are all residents of the neighborhood it gives you sort of of a feel what people are thinking and feeling - and I thought it was a good thing to have an open election. People feel that they could step up and run for office if they feel they haven’t been heard or they can just run for office because they feel like they have something to say and that their leadership can get a certain task done. I think it’s really an example of how our democracy work when you have ten people running for one seat. But actually I think everyone can learn from each other and I know I did, I was listening very closely to what my fellow candidates had to say and taking it in that they absolutely represent a train of thought in my district.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It was a hard campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of money was spent for and against you in the campaign.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Well I think a lot of the money that came in against me, I want to point out that we are out spent considerably, and the money from the people that supported me were labor unions and the working people of San Francisco. People who were against me were realtors, developers, tech, police, and some labor unions that want to build, build, build. And so I think it really represents how the city is changing and people think that big money can win a race, that they can interfere the democratic process of a district neighborhood election and spent a million dollars trying to win a neighborhood election.  The more money that was spent against us the harder we worked because we were adamant that big money was not going to win this race. People were going to win this race and I think that the results of the election just proved that.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the hardest challenge facing your district right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I think that it’s really about keeping our neighborhood intact as a neighborhood. That means keeping the people who live here, who want to live here so they can stay here, while we have some growth. We will have to grow on the west side but it isn’t “if we grow” its “how we grow”. I think we can grow without displacement and I think we can grow without gentrification taking over our small businesses and also our people on fixed income.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The thing about Richmond District is that 65% of people who live here are renters, and there is no rent control for small businesses, so if we grow too quickly, small businesses will be priced out and won’t be able to survive - and these are small business that has served our district for a very long time, most of them are “mom and pop” stores and I think we all have personal relationships with these stores.  So that growth that needs to happen needs to be very planned, and it needs to be intentional, and it has to intentionally not push out residents in the Richmond District.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geary’s Bus Rapid Transit was a very controversial topic during the election. Are you planning to support it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;My view on Geary BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) is that it is some what disturbing that that (the BRT) is the only thing dominating the conversation about transportation in the Richmond District. Because the BRT does not connect us to the rest of the city, I have told transit authorities that I can’t endorse it unless they can show me how this is part of a bigger plan so that residents of the Richmond can get to the other parts of SF. It takes me an hour or over to get to City College, an hour to the Mission, and the Geary BRT just takes us to down town.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;With all the development happening in Mission Bay and way out in Hunter’s Point and they are going to redo the (Hunter’s Point) Shipyard and a lot of new jobs out there, tell me how are we going to be connected to the rest of the city - they can’t answer that question, and until they can show me how this BRT actually connects us to a larger transportation system to serve the residents of the Richmond District I can’t get on board.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;When I meet Herb Meiberger at a café in the Castro, he brings his faithful service dog, Bark. Bark (pictured above) does not bark once. Rather, he silently tastes my hand in greeting, accepts some scratches behind the ear, and sits on my feet, presumably to guard me from predators.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“He likes you. That’s a good sign,” Meiberger observes. “If Bark trusts you, I can trust you.” Then and there, he opens up.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;For someone campaigning as a “watchdog,” Meiberger couldn’t have brought a more helpful allegory along.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mr. Meiberger is running for reelection to the Executive Board of San Francisco’s Employee Retirement System (SFERS), which oversees investment decisions on the city’s pension fund. As a Lecturer in Finance at San Francisco State University, he takes his duties assiduously, like a professor preparing curricula.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;campaign mailer courtesy of Herb Meiberger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“You need more than four days to review information and make a decision,” he says of a critique printed in an attack ad by his opponent, retired police captain Croce “Al” Casciato. Casciato has accused his opponent of delaying a decision over a $400 million investment in Chinese &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ashare.asp&quot;&gt;A-Share&lt;/a&gt; mutual funds. Though the assets would be controlled by the investment manager, SFERS staff is barred from revealing the managers’ names to prevent conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It was my idea, two years ago, to allocate funds in A-Shares. The Chinese stock market doubled in that time,” Meiberger says. “India and China are the future, especially now. Everyone knows that. After two years of nothing, staff comes back to us with this, which they want us to decide on in four days? I said we should do our homework, so of course I voted to delay. A few months later, I voted in favor of the investment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Meiberger relates these details in a joking, easygoing cadence, despite his frustrations. It’s as though he’s seen this all before.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;To him, it’s a culture divide. The pensioners organizing to unseat him are largely comprised of police and firefighters’ unions; Meiberger is a member of the SEIU 1021 union, the only “miscellaneous” elected board member. Ron Gold, a retired firefighter, wrote him a &lt;a href=&quot;http://herbmeiberger.com/hyc/herb-police-fire/#comment-10911&quot;&gt;glowing endorsement letter&lt;/a&gt; rife with barbed criticisms of the hedge-fund faction: “I retired from the SFFD in the early and frankly hope to outlast the pension fund’s assets,” Gold wrote, “which might not happen if they continue to play with hedges.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Meiberger takes his campaign mostly to those “miscellaneous” workforces—teachers, librarians, electricians, for example. Slightly under 60,000 San Franciscans are eligible to vote in the SFERS election, so Meiberger conducts most of his voter outreach on foot, bringing donuts and campaign literature to office lunch hours and chatting retirement finance with future pensioners.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;excerpt from page 2 of Meiberger's campaign mailer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mr. Meiberger is largely running on his decades of experience. “I served during all 17 years of Al Casciato’s time on the board,” he adds. “His record is also mine.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While Meiberger plans to disclose his campaign financing with the San Francisco Ethics Commission, he alleges that his opponent has circumvented this requirement with a clever trick. Casciato’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electcasciato.com/donate_to_al&quot;&gt;donation page&lt;/a&gt; refers donors to an address where they can mail checks—an address shared by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://campaignlawyers.com/&quot;&gt;law firm&lt;/a&gt; of election attorney Jim Sutton. Law firms are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/law-firms-accounts-pose-money-laundering-risk-1482765003&quot;&gt;exempt&lt;/a&gt; from requirements to disclose donations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“This election is the wolves versus the watchdogs,” he tells me when our interview formally begins. “That’s what it comes down to.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As we related in our previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/fear-and-finance-in-saint-francis-police-and-the-politics-of-city-pension-reform-part-1/&quot;&gt;coverage&lt;/a&gt;, Meiberger sees his opposition united around a singular cause: hedge funds. With high fees, low returns, and managers banking in Bermuda, Meiberger abhors this form of investment. Warren Buffett agreed with him. Further, he won’t speculate why his opponents advocate for them. “I have no idea,” is all he says. “Maybe it’s a fad.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Retired city employee Patrick Monette-Shaw offers a simpler theory. In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/pension-election-lies-may-cost-taxpayers-dearly/&quot;&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; for the San Francisco &lt;em&gt;Examiner&lt;/em&gt;, Monette-Shaw notes that hedge fund investors are attracted by “alpha” (yields exceeding projected returns). “The hedge fund details are SFERS’ only investment undisclosed to the public and plan participants…If gambling on increased alpha fails, and the fund loses millions of dollars, it will haunt taxpayers with increased General Fund employer-share contributions to prop up investment losses,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Much of the tension between Meiberger and hedge fund advocates emerged early last year when SFERS’ Chief Investment Officer Bill Coaker recommended a 15% allocation of the city’s pension fund ($3 billion of a fund valued at $20 billion) into hedge funds. Meiberger was told that the names and fees of external hedge fund managers could not be disclosed to the Board or the public. The board voted to allocate $1 billion, while Coaker began advocating for a 25% allocation – a full $5 billion – into hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though Meiberger prides himself on bridging the cultural gap in labor unions (he was made an honorary member of the Veterans Police Officers Association thanks to his twenty years on the SFERS board), lately he has seen unprecedented betrayals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;To his credit, Meiberger notes that Casciato referred to the SFPD’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mysfers.org/wp-content/uploads/SFERS-DROP-Brochure.pdf&quot;&gt;Deferred Retirement Option Program&lt;/a&gt; (DROP) as a “great deal.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;After Casciato retired from the Executive Board in 2012, the police and firefighters ran their own candidate, Brian Stansbury, to replace him. Stansbury lost to Gus Vallejo, whom Meiberger endorsed. It thus came as a shock to Meiberger when he saw Vallejo’s name co-signing an open letter in the POA journal urging him to resign.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t really spoken since,” Meiberger noted.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;He suspects that Joe Driscoll, a firefighter and former student of his, is the brains behind the campaign against him. “To date, he’s run three candidates to oppose me,” he says before laughing. Frankly, it is hard to tell what his laughter ever means.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;His laughter feels even more foreboding when he compares his record with Casciato’s. It’s the laughter one would expect from a finance professor who knows his bratty young students will one day grow up to run Goldman Sachs. “It’s like we were each on opposite sides during the 2008 mortgage crisis,” Meiberger notes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;According to Meiberger, one of his most notable accomplishments was selecting SFERS’ most successful bond managers, Greg White of the Scarsdale, NY-based firm Prima Capital Advisors. After investing in commercial mortgages and placing them in a trust, SFERS securitized the equity and saw 5% returns. As a result, SFERS’ bond credit rating was upgraded in 2008, at the beginning of the Great Recession.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“When did Casciato ask about investments?” he wonders aloud. “I don’t remember any time.” Quite the contrary, Meiberger and Driscoll took precisely the opposite approach during the same time, Meiberger alleges.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Meiberger claims that one of Casciato’s only strongly-expressed opinions was to support investing in commodities, a notoriously volatile market. In 2008, due to massive losses from securitized debt in Lehman Brothers, SFERS saw some of its accounts frozen. (Lehman Brothers’ catastrophic collapse is widely credited as a major catalyst of the 2008 financial crisis.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When I ask if these events spurred a change in the conversation regarding securities at the SFERS Board, Meiberger emits his loudest, most piercing laughter of the evening. “No,” he replies. “What would make you think that?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When we part ways, with Bark trotting at his side, Meiberger repeats his boastful prediction that Casciato will not speak to the press. So far, with the exception of an acknowledgement from his representative at Telegraph PR, he remains correct: the Casciato campaign has yet to respond to repeated requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview was originally published in the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebaycitybeacon.com&quot;&gt;Bay City Beacon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Mission District has always been the progressive stronghold of San Francisco politics. It’s been the seat of Former Assemblymember Tom Ammiano and outgoing Supervisor David Campos, elected officials who have prided themselves on being the progressive vanguard. That pattern of left-leaning leadership continues as Hillary Ronen becomes the first woman in modern district elections to represent the Mission.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ronen comes as a City Hall veteran, having served as Campos’ Chief of Staff for the last six years. She embraced those credentials throughout the campaign, leading to a solid victory this past November. Expect her to be the next progressive stalwart at City Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview below has been edited for clarity and brevity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your priorities for the first term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I have three top priorities - the first is to not only build and create affordable housing in the district but also pass and introduce policies that will help us get there. The second priority is to deal with homeless and the tent encampments in the Mission, which is partially related to housing but also has different components and aspects to it, and make sure that we are building more navigation centers so that there are dignified shelters for people to stay in until they get housing. The third priority is responding to the Trump administration, and protecting immigrants, protecting people’s health insurance and making sure that we can continue to implement police reform in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any immediate pieces of legislation you think about writing soon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I have a few pieces, they are dealing with homelessness and different housing issues in the Mission, and also protecting the Latino Cultural District around 24th street.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me your thoughts about how the election went this year for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It went extremely well in the end - I won, very candidly, with the vast majority of the votes, and it was an incredible learning experience. Incredible to talk to so many of the residents in the district and get to know the three neighborhoods on a deeper level, and I am incredibly happy with the resounding win. My excitement about that has been peppered by the results of the national election which was quite exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the campaign you talked about how we have to build towards affordability. You talked about building 5000 affordable units in the mission. Where do you see this housing going? And when do you expect it to come?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I want to build the 5000 affordable units over a 10-year period, some of those units are in the hopper right now, based on the work we been doing the past couple of years in David (Campos)’s office, and I am going to continue to fight for an average of 400-500 units a year going forward. It will be a mix of 100% affordable housing development, obtaining small sites and turning them into 100% permanent affordable housing, and then fighting for below-market-rate units and market-rate developments.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the hardest challenge facing your district right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Housing and homelessness, which were my top two priorities (on the campaign).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You spent time as David Campos’ Chief of Staff. What parts of this office or legislation style are you going to keep or change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;David (Campos) during his two terms in the office really focused a lot on city-wide issues in San Francisco, and I am really going to focusing inward on the district, at the issues that we been talking about housing, homelessness, schools - everything in our district - so I think that would be the main difference. I think what will be similar about us is that we both are very fierce fighters and we want to make sure the voices that are traditionally excluded from politics are front and center, and heard by the office and the city.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Transit advocates saw a major victory at San Francisco City Hall last night after the County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) voted unanimously to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/transit-officials-approve-final-eir-geary-bus-project/&quot;&gt;certify the Environmental Impact Report&lt;/a&gt; (EIR) for the Bus Rapid Transit project along Geary Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The dedicated center lanes for bus travel initially received a favorable feasibility report in 2004, after a funding shortfall rendered an underground subway proposal largely a pipe dream.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor London Breed, a commissioner on SFCTA, said that it had been her first goal upon winning her seat on the Board to “make magic happen” and replace all BRT projects with underground subways. Now, however, she was willing to accept that the project is something the city “can afford to accomplish.” Despite strenuous neighborhood efforts to delay the vote, the ten-person board unanimously agreed that it was high time to move the project forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Eric Mar, serving his penultimate day in office, eagerly expressed the need for faster bus service on one of the country’s busiest transit corridors. He made comparisons as far-ranging as Mexico City and Bogotá, Colombia to underscore the importance of dedicated lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfcta.org/prop-k-home&quot;&gt;The funding for Geary BRT&lt;/a&gt; was secured in 2003 with the passage of Proposition K, a half-cent sales tax measure that renewed 1989’s Proposition B.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Andrew Sullivan, who sat on the Expenditure Plan Advisory Committee for Proposition K, was optimistic to see the project finally coming to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“No way did we expect the process to take &lt;em&gt;thirteen years&lt;/em&gt; until the EIR when we approved the expenditure plan,” Mr. Sullivan wrote in an email. “Since that time, many BRT projects in North America including the LA Organge Line and Mexico City Metrobus have opened, while Geary has languished.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sullivan was also quick to dismiss concerns that Geary BRT approval could interfere with future plans for rail service. “Of course it's great news that the EIR has finally been approved, and we look forward to construction beginning ASAP,” he wrote.  “But we do also welcome the discussion of extending BART to the corridor.  There's no conflict between the two projects”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article initially appeared in the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebaycitybeacon.com/32740/260596/a/the-union-workhorse-ahsha-safai-excelsior&quot;&gt;Bay City Beacon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;We will be republishing subsequent interviews with new members of the Board of Supervisors next week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The common wisdom in San Francisco politics is that you only get one shot at being Supervisor - people don't lose a race and then come back to win the next one. Ahsha Safai seems to prove that common wisdom is commonly wrong.  8 years ago, he ran against the now-outgoing Supervisor John Avalos, and lost the race by a close margin.  In the time between his first run and this past one, Safai invested in his neighborhood, strengthened his relationships in the community, and raised a family.  Now he stands as the Excelsior's very own Comeback Kid.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As an elected official, Safai seems like a stunningly good match for his District.  A family man with a wife and two kids, he represents one of the most residential neighborhoods of the city.  A union organizer, his constituents are often card-carrying union members with working-class backgrounds.  His candidacy received endorsements from both progressive and moderate leaders, which is rare in the bloodsport of SF politics, but a good fit for a district that seems to care less about ideology and more about the ability to tackle everyday problems.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview below has been edited for clarity and brevity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your priorities for your first term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I knocked on every door in District 11 and intently listened to what people had to say. The issues I ran on are a reflection of those conversations -- what voters told me to address and not lose sight of. Some of the issues constantly raised were universal pre-school for four-year-olds (citywide and city funded), the construction of more workforce housing, lack of parking and homelessness. I will tackle these issues, and more, in a regimented and empirically driven manner. There is no substitute for hard work, and I am ready to work.  If your readers are inclined, they can visit my campaign website to learn more about these, and other, issues and how I plan to address them in a more detailed manner.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any immediate pieces of legislation you think about writing soon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to prematurely announce what I will or will not be drafting before I am in office, however as to what legislation I will personally shepherd, that is not a mystery. You can expect that whatever I draft will reflect the voters’ mandate. Again, my campaign’s platform is a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me your thoughts about how the election went this year for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;My race was challenging, but I expected that. I was diligent, spoke honestly about the issues and did not make false promises. People respect a straight shooter, and at the end of it all, I am happy to say that voters chose me to be their voice at City Hall. The campaign was a precursor to my impending tenure at City Hall – I will not sit idly, I will communicate with all stakeholders, and I will work hard to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both you and your opponent came from union backgrounds, your race was considered to split labor. How are you going to mend or rebuild that coalition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Reasonable minds can, and will, disagree. Although groups splintered into two camps, I never lost sight of the simple fact that at the end of the day we were all engaged because we had one simple goal: to uplift all San Franciscans. I will have an open door policy, will welcome everyone and will build coalitions to craft laws that positively impact our city’s residents.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the hardest challenge facing your district right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I have an aversion to hyperbole; right now we face many pressing issues with no simple answers. A key issue, again, one of many, is the lack of workforce housing. Many people are being priced out because they just can’t qualify for aid, our housing crisis is real and damaging. I will put forward comprehensive solutions that will increase funding and eradicate red tape, and I will work with allies at all levels of government to tackle our housing ills. Like I said, going back to my original point, there are a whole host of challenges and it is my duty to address them as best and quickly as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a citizen, you organized hundreds of neighbors to oppose Medical Cannabis Dispensaries. There is a new dispensary going into San Bruno Ave, what are your thoughts about that and are you going to continue to oppose future MCDs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I am not anti-science or anti-cannabis, however what I am against is over-saturation. I opposed the opening of more medical marijuana dispensaries (MCDs) in District 11 because that burden was disproportionately falling on residents from that area.  And, it was also an issue that was constantly raised by people when I spoke to them directly. It is also inappropriate for me to say what I would vote for or against before the matter is presented to the Board of Supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Kaplan, Oakland’s City Councilmember-at-large, convened a forum in City Hall with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/OaktownWarehouseCoalition/&quot;&gt;Oakland Warehouse Coalition&lt;/a&gt; last night. A panel including Councilmembers Gallo and Kalb, religious leaders, non-profit activists, and private sector organizers briefly discussed policy responses to the deadly Ghost Ship warehouse fire that killed 36 concertgoers on December 2nd. Over the course of three hours, attendance ranged from standing-room only to a handful of stragglers after the final public comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“As I see it, there’s no reason we can’t fight for fire safety and protecting people from displacement,” Kaplan said. “Whether it’s fire safety or lead paint safety, we shouldn’t accept that displacing everybody is the only solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kaplan mentioned pending legislation she would be bringing before the Council’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/191829997947283/&quot;&gt;Community Economic Development Committee&lt;/a&gt; to protect tenants from eviction as a result of code compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Central to the discussion was a proposed ordinance passed around the room printed on neon green paper by the Oakland Warehouse Coalition, the Emergency Tenant Protection Ordinance. The proposal includes many popular provisions—such as extending Just Cause eviction protection to tenants in properties not zoned for residential use—and other proposals widely not expected to be considered. For example, the Warehouse Coalition calls for the city to seize underutilized warehouse spaces via eminent domain to donate to artists.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The meeting began at an awkward pace, as many audible groans could be heard from the audience when a speaker quoted the bible for a second time in the first five minutes. “I’m a pagan,” the woman next to me grumbled. “Can I get up and say something irrelevant?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Yet Kaplan dissuaded attendees from seeing her own religious background as a form of exclusion. Alluding to President-elect Donald Trump’s Muslim registry proposal, she declared that she intended to sign up for any such registry herself if it were introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Reverend Ken Chambers of the Westside Missionary Baptist Church adhered to concrete policy issues, discussing various financial hurdles to publicly financing affordable housing projects. In his view, tax liens imposed on vacant properties had some potential, but were insufficient. “The problem with those liens is, if you don’t have enough properties together, it doesn’t pencil out.” On the other hand, private developers, he argued, could muster the financing to make such projects work when they bought up properties, but that that made the need for inclusionary zoning policies even more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Two members of the panel were residents of undocumented live-work spaces themselves, including Jonah Strauss, a co-founder of the Oakland Warehouse Coalition. After briefly discussing the merits of the proposed ordinance, Strauss noted that the eviction of artists living at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2016/01/28/dozens-of-renters-lose-homes-as-city-closes-1919-market-street-warehouse-in-oakland&quot;&gt;1919 Market Street&lt;/a&gt; warehouse had been “encouraged by the owners.” He urged immediate action from the City Council to prevent landlords from knowingly fostering building code violations in order to evict tenants at their convenience.
“99.9% of live-work spaces in Oakland don’t look anything like the Ghost Ship. We don’t build like that,” Strauss said to marked applause.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The panel quickly expanded beyond the topic of housing and code enforcement to include calls for job training and a stronger social safety net for low-income residents. Susan Harmon of the Oakland non-profit Planting Justice not only described plans to create a “tiny homes” village on city land in West Oakland, but also called for a Guaranteed Basic Income to end the cycle of poverty for the most vulnerable Oaklanders.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But the bulk of the three hours, and the majority of the city’s pent-up frustrations regarding crushing economic inequality, was dominated by an open public comment period.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/oakland-town-hall-addresses-inequality-warehouse-displacement/oakmtg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 50% of the line to deliver public comment at Oakland City Hall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;James Vann, an attorney with the Oakland Tenants Union, advocated for wider-reaching policy reform at the state level. “We think the definition of affordable housing must change,” Vann said, citing a current threshold of 60% Area Median Income as inadequate. (While some Below Market Rate units are price-indexed for 80-120% AMI, the Department of Housing and Urban Development defines “low-income” at 60-80%.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The majority of evictions are not caused by tenants,” he continued. Vann went on to advocate for a “flipping or speculation” tax so that real estate property transfers would fund city services and subsidized cooperative housing such as the Oakland Land Trust. He further urged the city to enforce owner occupancy for Ellis Act “owner move-in” evictions and require landlords to accept federal Section 8 vouchers.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Several homeless speakers, the majority of them black, spoke angrily of the city’s failure to care for its growing homeless population. While some described the situation as “genocide,” others offered tutorials in business law administered under the 29th Street freeway overpass, and another urged the council to reduce fines for parking violations in order to decriminalize living in cars.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many speakers came to corroborate Strauss’s argument that code compliance posed a significant threat for tenants. “I have so many documented personal stories of competent building inspectors being used in the wrong place,” one speaker said. “In one place with no fire code violations, they simply gave a cease-and-desist, which landlords use to void leases.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;To cries of outrage from the audience, proprietors of the Everett &amp;amp; Jones restaurant in Jack London Square announced that they had been served a notice of violation for hosting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Lefebvre_Sam/status/816843769592979456&quot;&gt;benefit concert&lt;/a&gt; without a cabaret license. Journalist Sam Lefebvre, who lives next door to the restaurant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Lefebvre_Sam/status/816843769592979456&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; a picture of the notice.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Local artist B.G. Anaraki mused on the larger problem represented by art spaces and live-work houses. “When I moved in 2006 it seemed my landlord was very eager to learn that we were artists and that we would be hosting parties. It was a house, not a warehouse. My theory is that they used us to further the decades-long agenda of pushing out historical residents of Oakland.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Anaraki described reliving the experience of watching the Ghost Ship burn whenever he closed his eyes at night. “Now when I have my eyes open I have to worry about all my friends being on the street, and it’s a shame.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A former resident of the Ghost Ship warehouse came with only two statements: thanking the public for their support, and urging immediate action. “I know that fire doesn’t wait,” she said. “It doesn’t wait for permits…Don’t wait.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Councilmembers Gallo and Kaplan stated that they would be supporting the proposed Emergency Ordinance. (Kalb had departed by the time they delivered their closing statements.) Oakland City Council returns from its winter recess on Tuesday, January 17.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;California’s high housing costs are central to the state’s struggle with growing economic inequality. As state agencies analyze the causes and impacts of the chronic urban housing shortage, analysts have also begun zeroing in on the unique manifestations of the current widening income gap.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the Legislative Analyst’s Office released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3518&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; titled “Income Mobility in California Across Generations,“ illustrating a variety of characteristics underpinning California’s unique status as one of the country’s poorest and wealthiest states. The data is myriad and wide-ranging, but several firm conclusions stand out: while Californians generally see more income mobility across generations, this is not due to living in California.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While California sees higher intergenerational income mobility than the national average, moving to California is a statistically unwise choice for low-income families hoping to see their children prosper. Indeed, income mobility across generations was lowest in the top and bottom fifths of income levels. More populous counties such as San Francisco and Los Angeles saw greater income mobility than rural counties in decline, suggesting strong correlations between intergenerational mobility and proximity to diverse demographics and thriving job markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;So what does this have to do with housing?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Readers may recall a &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/chang-tai.hsieh/research/growth.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; coauthored by UC Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti which found that the urban housing shortage nationwide holds back annual GDP growth by nearly 10%. Moretti, a renowned expert on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nber.org/chapters/c7977.pdf&quot;&gt;agglomeration effects&lt;/a&gt;, argues that a lack of housing options stagnates real wage growth.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This week, California’s Office of Housing and Community Development (HCD) released a draft of its next Statewide Housing Assessment, “California’s Housing Future: Challenges and Opportunities.” Not surprisingly, the statewide housing shortage has a greater negative impact on populations facing the brunt of restricted income mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Among its most straightforward conclusions: “[l]ack of supply and rising costs are compounding growing inequality for younger Californians.” This state accounts for 22% of the country’s homeless population, and a staggering 33% of Californians pay at least half of their income toward rent.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;HCD found that new housing construction continues to be outpaced by demand, with only 80,000 dwelling units built statewide compared to an anticipated need of 180,000. Housing production has focused on single-family homes, whereas the decades between 1955 and 1990 saw a much higher production of multifamily dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;With an estimated population growth of 11 million by 2050, HCD concludes that the state needs 1.8 million more homes by 2025. Moreover, the vast increase in rents relative to wage growth will continue to disproportionately impact the California’s black, Hispanic, Pacific Islander and Native American populations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;(source: California HCD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, amending this supply shortfall in dense urban centers is described as a significant opportunity to curb the environmental detriments of sprawl, though HCD acknowledges that this is difficult to measure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The proximity of jobs, services, density, and the availability of public transportation are among the factors that can affect the need for automobile travel and thus transportation costs. In certain communities, higher housing costs can be mitigated by lower transportation costs when less affordable travel is required…Unlike housing affordability, which is widely accepted as paying no more than 30% of income towards housing costs, there is no official definition for housing and transportation costs combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As the title implies, the report proceeds to identify opportunities to meet these strenuous policy challenges. The most significant opportunity identified is that of streamlining timely and costly local land-use discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Barriers and constraints (such as lengthy development review, lack of certainty…and local opposition) impact the type, quantity, and location of housing built…Local governments do not permit enough housing to meet their need, in part because they face competing priorities throughout the development process, including community opposition, incentives to approve sales-tax generating development…rather than residential development, and market conditions…In addition, lack of enforcement of State housing laws limit the effectiveness of existing tools intended to guide housing development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/state-agencies-weigh-in-on-housing-and-mobility/hcd-constraits.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;(source: California HCD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;To ameliorate these compounding delays, HCD recommends streamlining the entitlement process and only maintaining public input “early and upfront” in the process. Further recommendations include greater regional cooperation and enforcement of State housing laws to ensure certainty and financial feasibility for new development. To amend the shortage of low-income housing, HCD also recommends reserving surplus public lands for deed-restricted or other forms of permanently affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, intergenerational economic mobility in California is largely restricted to those already blessed with greater demographic potential for mobility. Your family, not your location, is your greatest measure of earning potential. Housing costs are a critical culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ben Metcalf, the Director of HCD, sees a silver lining in all this. In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-housing-affordability-1483490282-htmlstory.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the Los Angeles &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, he remarked: “If there is good news in all this, these are, in some cases, problems that we have created through local and state policies…because these are challenges that have been created through policies, we know we can fix them.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://boomcalifornia.com/&quot;&gt;Boom California&lt;/a&gt; recently published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://boomcalifornia.com/2016/12/29/a-boom-interview-in-conversation-with-jennifer-wolch-and-dana-cuff/&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Mike Davis, a “chronicler of the California dark side and LA’s underbelly,” and advocate for community planning. I’ve [excerpted] &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hanlonbt/status/802318722429952000&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/hanlonbt/status/802318722429952000&lt;/a&gt;) sections from Davis’ best-known work, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ouleft.org/wp-content/uploads/Mike_Davis_City_of_Quartz.pdf&quot;&gt;“City of Quartz,”&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter to highlight how Los Angeles homeowners demanded land use and tax policies that enriched themselves while furthering racial and class exclusion. Davis is a talented prose stylist with a knack for skewering profiteering and segregationist Angelenos, but his lack of understanding of real estate markets leads him to support perverse policies. Below, I discuss shortcomings in his “progressive” approach and propose four suggestions when thinking about land use policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devise policy to limit home prices, not land prices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Davis assumes that “the stabilization of land values is the precondition for long-term democratic planning.” Like Davis, I support a Georgist Land-Value Tax, but the real problem for low- and middle-income people isn’t high land prices, it’s high home prices. Few people live on unimproved land. High land prices are a market signal to use land more intensely, i.e., to build dense housing instead of detached single-family homes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In hyper-expensive San Francisco, land acquisition costs are a small portion of the costs for new condo towers, but they are the majority of the costs for detached single-family homes. Urban policy that values class and racial inclusion will limit home-price appreciation by permitting more homes to be built.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most poor people live in market-rate housing. Don’t abandon them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Aside from a Land-Value Tax, Davis’ other big “nonrevolutionary” solution is to more strictly regulate land use. He wants to “municipalize strategic parts of the land inventory for affordable housing, parks and form-giving greenbelts.” Those are fine ideas IF the city either a) builds massive amounts of social housing on restricted land (politically &amp;amp; fiscally impossible) or b) permits private developers to meet the need for housing on unrestricted land (politically hard, fiscally easy, but not what Davis supports).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, home prices will climb and the poor will be displaced. Rent control helps incumbent residents, but does little for low-income migrants. If local policymakers seek to prevent displacement and permit in-migration of low-income people, they need to think more about the real estate market and less about publicly subsidized housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value a diversity of uses and urban play over rigid long-term planning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, Davis supports “long-term democratic planning” and thinks developers ruin social democracy by engaging in the political process to secure variances for their projects. On the other hand, Davis wants to allow a “democratic variety” in urban space and encourage “unprogrammed fun and discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;These desires are incompatible. Limiting development and prescribing permissible land use activities restricts in-migration to wealthy residents and proscribes the creative adaptation of disused space. Weirdo 22 year-old artists aren’t going to apply for a below-market-rate housing waiting list, they’re going to move where rent and studio space are cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic dynamism militates against long-term planning. Support flexible land use policies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Davis believes “if you don’t intervene in the operation of land markets, you’ll usually end up producing the opposite result from what you intended.” As &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/stanford-law-policy-review/print/2014/01/mangin_25_stan._l._poly_rev_91.pdf&quot;&gt;housing scholarship&lt;/a&gt; makes clear, the reality is the opposite – if cities intervene in the operation of land markets via restrictive zoning, they may lower the price of land, but will increase the price of homes and worsen segregation. That’s not to say there is no need for infrastructure planning and encouraging home building along transit corridors, but councils of local residents are unlikely to concern themselves with the interests of nonresidents and therefore shouldn’t direct policy. What’s more, would-be planners face many unknown unknowns. As a former manager of the Communist Party’s bookstore, Mike Davis should take Marx’s analysis of capitalism in the “The Communist Manifesto” seriously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Not only do localities further exclusion when given the opportunity, they attempt to preserve existing built form and use when changed economic and social conditions demand alternatives. Marx could have been writing about California land use and tax policy when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm&quot;&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt;, “the tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.” Let’s embrace the future by surrendering our futile desires for stability. Achieving inclusive communities demands it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brian Hanlon is co-Executive Director of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlaef.org/&quot;&gt;California Renters Legal Advocacy and Education Fund&lt;/a&gt; (CaRLA).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Alfred Twu wants your vote. But there’s a catch—if you live in California Assembly District 15, you must show up &lt;em&gt;in person&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&amp;amp;pb=!1s0x80857934a4c28ae1:0x6188fb3430cdbde0!2m19!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m13!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!3m1!7e115!4zaHR0cDovL2FseW91bmcub3JnLzIwMTQvMDMv!5salbany+library+-+Google+Search&amp;amp;imagekey=!1e1!2shttp://alyoung.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/albany-lib-5.jpg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5h9ua56bRAhUD5mMKHVl5Du8QoioIcTAK&quot;&gt;Albany Library&lt;/a&gt; from noon to 2pm. There you can cast votes for him, along with his slate of 13 other Democrats, for Assembly District Delegate. “Tell people to bring a pen,” he says at the conclusion of our interview. “We usually run out pretty quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Does this sound too obscure and pointless to warrant your involvement? If you care about affecting policy change in California, you couldn’t be more wrong. Assembly Delegates serve two-year terms in which they attend annual state conventions to discuss policy initiatives and help shape the California Democratic Party’s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In a state controlled by a Democratic supermajority in the legislature, that’s tantamount to setting policy writ large.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Wherever the party agrees, the other side can’t stop us,” Twu says.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Twu ran as a party delegate pledging his vote to Senator Bernie Sanders during last year’s presidential primary. Building off that momentum, he now forms part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/1239369576157208/&quot;&gt;Democrats Rising&lt;/a&gt; slate for AD15, organized by East Bay Young Democrats member Seren Pendleton-Knoll.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/meet-the-democrat-who-wants-california-democrats-to-focus-on-the-big-issues/adem-front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats Rising slate card, designed by Alfred Twu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I decided to run because I wanted to make housing a bigger part of the Democratic Party platform. I think out here, and really in most part of the country, housing is the largest expense people have,” Twu says. “With the mortgage interest deduction, and the bailouts of 2008, housing policy mostly focuses on homeowners. There’s not much talk about housing policy for people who rent.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Rent control comprises one of the slate’s top issues, as the urban housing shortage has led to a widespread outcry against California’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/its-time-to-overturn-the-state-ban-on-rent-control/Content?oid=4229744&quot;&gt;Costa Hawkins Act&lt;/a&gt;, which banned price controls for rental property built after 1975. “Right now people are hurting and need relief right away,” Twu says. “While more housing down the road will certainly help, the more immediate need is to get rent control in cities that don’t have the tradition of strong rent control we see in San Francisco and Oakland.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;By-right construction entitlement, a policy that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/09/21/commentary-jerry-browns-by-right-housing-plan-needs-another-try/&quot;&gt;Governor Jerry Brown&lt;/a&gt; tried and failed to pass last year, is far thornier in Twu’s mind, but he remains optimistic. “Making it easier to build new housing could shift people’s attention from being greedy landlords to extracting profit from building new buildings. In reality, there’s a lot of overlap between landlords and developers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Twu also points to the demographic and political advantages central to the slate campaign strategy, which helps the candidates cover issues outside of their own primary focus. “Often, with forming a slate, the idea is getting people who are similar, but not too similar, so they all turn out different constituencies,” he says. His own constituency, in his view, is primarily formed of UC Berkeley students and pro-housing activist groups throughout the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full roster of the Democrats Rising AD15 slate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Democrats Rising slate is comprised of seven men and seven women from all across the district, ranging from Hercules and Richmond to North Oakland. “Other people on our slate [Ben Choi and Melvin Willis] were recently elected to the Richmond City Council, so they have their campaign volunteers and supporters. That’s why fracking and the oil trade, stopping Chevron in Richmond, are also among our big issues,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/AD15Delegates2014/&quot;&gt;rival slate&lt;/a&gt; is kind of similar to ours, geographically speaking,” he notes, “but that slate was put together by our local Assembly member Tony Thurmond.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that different Assembly Districts vote for their delegates at different times. While AD15 votes on Saturday at noon, AD17 in San Francisco votes on Sunday at 10am. San Francisco’s western Assembly District, AD19, votes in Daly City on Saturday. You can find your Assembly District Delegate election &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cadem.org/our-party/adem/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Last week, we &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/chiu-seeks-additional-housing-funds-by-ending-real-estate-tax-benefit/&quot;&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; Assemblymember David Chiu’s (D-SF) proposed bill to end the mortgage interest tax deduction for second homes to increase funding for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). Since then, we’ve interviewed Assm. Chiu to discuss an &lt;a href=&quot;http://asmdc.org/members/a17/news-room/press-releases/assemblymember-david-chiu-joins-colleagues-to-announce-bills-to-address-affordable-housing-crisis&quot;&gt;entire package of ambitious legislation&lt;/a&gt; aimed at curbing the state’s crisis-level housing shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In sum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB71&quot;&gt;AB 71&lt;/a&gt; would eliminate the mortgage interest deduction that taxpayers can currently claim on a second home, typically a vacation residence. “Economists across the spectrum agree that the Mortgage Interest Deduction is highly regressive,” Chiu said. Because lower-income households typically do not itemize their deductions, the MID largely benefits higher-earning households. In 2012, 77% of benefits accrued from the federal MID went to those with incomes higher than $100,000 per year. Chiu estimates that the vacation home deduction cost California’s general fund $360 million in the past fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB72&quot;&gt;AB 72&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by Assemblymember Miguel Santiago (D-LA), would allocate funds for the state Attorney General’s office to enforce the &lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;amp;sectionNum=65589.5&quot;&gt;Housing Accountability Act&lt;/a&gt;. So far, only private entities have sought litigation under the HAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB73&quot;&gt;AB 73&lt;/a&gt; would create an incentive payments for cities to zone at higher densities and permit the construction of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) with a minimum allotment of 20% of dwelling units price-indexed for middle- and lower-income households. The bill includes an environmental review component and prevailing wage requirement for union labor, two factors largely believed to have stalled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/08/unions-against-gov-browns-as-of-right-housing-plan.html&quot;&gt;Governor Jerry Brown’s housing streamlining proposa&lt;/a&gt;l this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB74&quot;&gt;AB 74&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Housing for a Healthy California Act, would create a funding program to house chronically homeless Californians enrolled in Medi-Cal services. In other words, the bill explicitly ties supportive housing to healthcare funding. “To break the endless cycle of the revolving doors of emergency rooms, inpatient facilities, treatment centers and nursing homes,” Chiu wrote in a press release, “this new program would shift the paradigm by providing rental assistance for supportive housing to those individuals who are both homeless and receive significant public health care services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In our interview, Assemblymember Chiu spoke more broadly of difficult times ahead under a Trump administration. “The threat to cut federal healthcare spending alone,” he said, “is very daunting” when considering its impact on the state’s budget. When asked if this could lead to reform for so-called “third-rail” fiscal issues, such as the property tax cap codified under Proposition 13, Chiu simply stated: “Everything is on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;When a city employee retires, should they draw a pension on your dime?—or theirs? Finding an acceptable middle ground for all stakeholders is becoming an increasingly heated topic as San Francisco &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/S-F-s-big-budget-falling-short-on-pensions-9214186.php&quot;&gt;anticipates a budget shortfall&lt;/a&gt; of several billion dollars, partly comprised of pension obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Herb Meiberger, a Chartered Financial Analyst who serves on the Executive Board of the San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System (SFERS), seems to understand the fundamental root of this tension. “[Union] members want lower employee contributions, and taxpayers want higher contributions. That’s the crux of the issue,” he said in a brief phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The SFERS Executive Board sets policy for the city’s pension fund, including percentages of asset allocations among stocks, bonds, and private equity. The fund’s total assets were valued at $20.4 billion last year. Assuming a 7.5% Return On Investment, the city is currently only able to guarantee 89.9% of its obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Underlying the heated election for Meiberger’s seat on the Board is a widening cultural rift over basic priorities in public retirement investments. For some, Cost Of Living Adjustment benefits (COLA) necessitate riskier investments for higher returns; others contend that inherently volatile capital markets require the utmost caution—or at the very least, an investor’s “due diligence”—when dealing with the livelihoods of retirees.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Meiberger sees himself as a “watchdog,” and in his view, his cautious and skeptical nature has made him powerful enemies. Former SFERS Board President Croce “Al” Casciato has boasted of raising nearly $185,000 in a little-known election to unseat Meiberger, who he accuses of costing SFERS millions with poor decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Casciato, a retired police captain, retired from SFERS in 2012. Recently, according to Larry Barsetti of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protectourbenefits.org/index.php/action-alert/&quot;&gt;Protect Our Benefits PAC&lt;/a&gt;, a coalition of unions privately urged Casciato to run against Meiberger for a seat on the Board. The coalition includes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifpte21.org/content/elect-al-and-protect-your-retirement-benefits&quot;&gt;IFPTE Local 21&lt;/a&gt;, IBEW Local 6, Union of American Physicians and Dentists, Municipal Executives Association, Municipal Attorneys Association, San Francisco Police Officer’s Association (SFPOA), San Francisco Veteran Police Officer’s Association (SFVPOA), Plumbers Local 38, and Teamsters Local 856.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campaign mailer for Al Casciato&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The October 20th journal of the SFPOA included an open letter urging Meiberger to withdraw his bid for reelection. Retired city employee Patrick Monette-Shaw penned an open letter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stoplhhdownsize.com/What_Price_for_a_Seat_at_the_Retirement_Board_Table.pdf&quot;&gt;in response&lt;/a&gt;, challenging, among other things, Casciato’s claims that the city’s pension fund had lost $2 billion over the past few years. Though Casciato’s candidate statement asserts a $1.5 billion loss—$500 million less than his campaign mailer alleges—Monette-Shaw argues that a recent valuation found a much smaller shortfall of $422 million. Monette-Shaw’s letter goes on to describe a betrayal that “smacks of ethical bankruptcy,” given POA’s endorsement of Meiberger in 2006, and IFTPE Local 21 endorsing him as recently as 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Why the sudden shift?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It’s all about hedge funds,” Meiberger shoots back. “They want hedge funds, I don’t. They want some lapdog, they don’t want a watchdog.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attack ad on Herb Meiberger (same mailer as above)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp&quot;&gt;Hedge funds&lt;/a&gt; are a form of limited partnership investments in which pooled funds can be leveraged with borrowed money in pursuit of higher returns. The industry of specialized investment managers has gained popular appeal due to a relative dearth of restrictions from the Securities and Exchange Commission relative to more traditional forms of investment with lower risks, such as mutual funds or index funds.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;On February 11, 2015, Meiberger was the sole “No” vote on the Board when SFERS sought to invest $3 billion of pensions, 15% of its total assets, in hedge funds. Meiberger even &lt;a href=&quot;http://herbmeiberger.com/retirement-board-news/due-diligence/&quot;&gt;sought advice personally&lt;/a&gt; from investment magnate Warren Buffett, who warned him categorically against hedge funds. “I would not go with hedge funds – would prefer index funds,” Mr. Buffett wrote in reply. Eventually, the Board only approved a $1 billion investment.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Hedge fund managers often achieve a status akin to rock stars in the world of finance. Anthony Scaramucci, a top economic advisor to Donald Trump, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/hedge-fund-impresario-plays-host-in-las-vegas/?_r=0&quot;&gt;once wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “Mutual funds are the propeller plane, while hedge funds are the fighter jets.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Simon Lack, author of the seminal 2012 book &lt;em&gt;The Hedge Fund Mirage,&lt;/em&gt; argued that hedge funds bear lower returns and higher management costs relative to treasury bills. “Once a public pension plan recognizes that 5% is a better allocation to hedge funds than 20%,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brandes.com/docs/default-source/brandes-institute/the-hedge-fund-mirage-qa-simon-lack&quot;&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, “they’re no longer relying on hedge funds to solve their funding gap, and consequently they can select more esoteric managers. This is how hedge fund investing was done during the period of time whose historic returns were generated that they’re seeing to emulate.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The political rift over hedge funds reached a breaking point in the SFERS after a controversial Currency Overlay Hedge Fund investment lost the SFERS Fund nearly $70 million, over Meiberger’s strong objections. (The Currency Overlay strategy was designed to attenuate leveraged risks with favorable foreign currency exchange rates.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While the majority of the Board has sought to reduce SFERS’s hedge fund allocations from 15% to 5%, their Chief Investment Officer recommended an allocation of 25%. This move appears to have galvanized Casciato’s supporters against Meiberger’s perceived moderation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It’s a power issue,” Meiberger speculates. “They like to be associated with billionaire hedge fund managers, and want to get their pictures taken together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Meiberger adds that hedge funds are riskier not only due to their fees and returns, but a lack of liquidity. In September of 2014, the California Public Employees Retirement Sytem (CalPERS) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonhartley/2014/09/22/why-calpers-is-exiting-the-hedge-fund-space/#7fff8579101f&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; to liquidate $4 billion in hedge funds. Two years later, CalPERS &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2016/01/13/calpers-hedge-funds-2/&quot;&gt;has yet to completely divest&lt;/a&gt; from hedge funds due to their inherent illiquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;With the exception of an endorsing campaign mailer funded by the SEIU 1021, Meiberger says he is running a self-funded grassroots campaign. Candidates have not yet filed campaign finance reports with the city’s Ethics Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: We will be running subsequent parts of this story next week after scheduled interviews with both Casciato and Meiberger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;As the despondency and disgust for the burning dumpster fire that is 2016 gives way to dread and ambivalence toward the unknown horrors of 2017, we wish to alert our readers to an abundance of political and cultural happenings taking place in the Greater Bay Area Metropolis as of next week. This may also serve as a subtle preview for next week’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Monday, January 2nd: &lt;strong&gt;The Ivy Room&lt;/strong&gt; in Albany hosts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/1074708429321927/&quot;&gt;a tribute&lt;/a&gt; to Berkeley’s iconic punk imprint Lookout! Records as part of a week-long &lt;em&gt;Lookouting&lt;/em&gt; retrospective. The concert will feature resurrected punk bands from days of yore—the spastic, slapstick Surrogate Brains from Stockton, and Santa Rosa booze-laden garage-punks The Invalids—along with Dr. Frank, the polymath auteur behind classic pop-punk outfit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xn9ZhmY_10&quot;&gt;The Mr. T Experience&lt;/a&gt;. $10 / 21+ / 8pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, January 3rd: The &lt;strong&gt;San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency&lt;/strong&gt; (SFMTA) Board of Directors meeting will be held at 1:00pm in City Hall, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place, Room 400. The Board is widely expected to approve the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the Geary Bus Rapid Transit project, which would dedicate a lane on either side of Geary Boulevard to Muni buses. With an initial feasibility report completed in 2007, Geary BRT is nearly a decade in the making, but evidently, some still feel that change has come too soon. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/transit-officials-offer-tweaks-to-geary-brt-project/&quot;&gt;Despite local pressure&lt;/a&gt; for the Board to delay approval to make time for more “community input,” former Richmond District Supervisor Eric Mar argued that “endless delays” were no longer necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, January 4th: &lt;strong&gt;Oakland Councilmember-at-large Rebecca Kaplan&lt;/strong&gt; will host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/1543924842289311/&quot;&gt;a forum with the Oakland Warehouse Coalition&lt;/a&gt; in Council  Chambers, Oakland City Hall,  at 5pm to discuss the city’s responses to the Ghost Ship warehouse fire. Kaplan’s office has announced: “The forum will address housing, homelessness, and jobs, and will be focused on solutions. We’d love for you to come and bring folks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

The project seeks to add a public plaza on Oak Street, to be serviced by new elevators to the Van Ness Muni station below. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.themarkcompany.com/project/one-oak/&quot;&gt;The Mark Company&lt;/a&gt;, the developer behind One Oak, will need to extend the Height and Bulk District 120/400-R-2 designation across the block for the design to be zoning-compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Friday, January 6th: Oakland techno showcase &lt;strong&gt;Obscura Machina&lt;/strong&gt; will go on as planned, despite the passing of its gregarious organizer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/in-memoriam-micah-danemayer/&quot;&gt;Micah Danemayer&lt;/a&gt;, in the tragic Ghost Ship fire. Danemayer’s collaborator Devyn Saturnus will debut their new project Red Cellar as part of his plans to carry on the torch for his fallen friend’s imprint, Discarded Records. Red Cellar will be joined by the dark, minimal electro-croonings of &lt;a href=&quot;https://stacian.bandcamp.com/album/songs-for-cadets&quot;&gt;Stacian&lt;/a&gt;, the industrial duo &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/glowingdaggerrecords/sets/plattenbau-body-of-desire&quot;&gt;Plattenbau&lt;/a&gt;, lo-fi ambient producer &lt;a href=&quot;https://discardedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/fascination-scenarios-of-violence-009-2&quot;&gt;Fascination&lt;/a&gt;, and Los Angeles-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/djsailorsaturn/&quot;&gt;DJ Sailor Saturn&lt;/a&gt;. The event will be held at The Night Light, 311 Broadway, Oakland. All proceeds will fund the Micah Danemayer Memorial Scholarship at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. $7 / 21+ / 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Yesterday morning, Judge Beth McGowen approved a restraining order filed against the City of Mountain View by the California Apartment Association (CAA) to halt the implementation of a voter-approved rent control ordinance known as Measure V. The order stipulates that protections against just-cause evictions are to remain in place, meaning that tenants could still feasibly resist evictions filed in anticipation of caps on rent increases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;By 4:30pm, the Mountain View Tenants Coalition (MVTC) had organized a demonstration in front of City Hall to protest the decision. Mountain View’s City Council voted in a closed session to encourage City Attorney Jamie Quinn to accept the temporary restraining order. The CAA is expected to seek an injunction against Measure V in February or March. Until then, tenants will have no legal recourse to protect themselves from rent increases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The temporary restraining order is effective through February 3, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Median rents in Mountain View have increased by over $1000 in the past five years, with some estimates closer to $2,000. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zillow.com/mountain-view-ca/home-values/&quot;&gt;Zillow&lt;/a&gt; estimates the median home price at $1.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“[The council] tried to sabotage Measure V by putting a competing measure on the ballot,” said Daniel DeBolt, spokesperson for MVTC. “It was confusing because it was also a rent control measure, but much weaker.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;He credited the grassroots organizing of at least 150 Tenants Coalition volunteers, who were able to pass Measure V with only $43,000 raised in campaign funds.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;DeBolt also insisted that many opponents’ arguments were specious or unsupported by data. Measure V specifically exempts new developments, and allows landlords to pass through capital improvement costs to tenants, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yesonvmv.org/faq&quot;&gt;MVTC says&lt;/a&gt; invalidates claims that rent control would hinder construction or disincentivize maintenance of rental properties.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is that landlords lost, and the council lost. Now they’re neglecting their duty as public officials to uphold the law, allowing landlords to get this temporary restraining order before we could intervene,” DeBolt continued. “It’s totally shameful.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;DeBolt qualified his criticism by noting that Councilmember Lenny Siegel and Mayor Pat Showalter largely supported Measure V, though the mayor was hesitant to support it as a charter amendment that would be more difficult to amend or repeal.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Ironically,” DeBolt added, “the City Council declared Mountain View a ‘human rights city’ this week, but they refuse to honor and defend the renters rights that voters approved on November 8.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A relatively quiet decision by California’s First Circuit Court of Appeals may have significant impacts on future lawsuits regarding urban infrastructure. In &lt;em&gt;The Committee for Re-Evaluation of the T-Line Loop v. San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, et al,&lt;/em&gt; the appellate court dismissed a suit seeking to require a new Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the expansion of the T-Line Muni Train into San Francisco’s Bayview neighborhood. Drawing from the precedent of a previous case from this year, &lt;em&gt;Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College District&lt;/em&gt;, the court ruled that the SFMTA could proceed with the project relying on an EIR from 1998, rather than having to submit a new report.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The T-Line Loop was originally designed as part of the Third Street Light Rail Project, which submitted an EIR in 1998. Due to budget shortfalls, the expansion was stalled until 2013, when SFMTA received a $10 million grant from the Federal Transportation Agency to complete infrastructure projects in the Mission Bay and Bayview area.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The particular loop in question would allow trains to turn around midway through the line to accommodate passengers for special events at AT&amp;amp;T Park and other nearby venues. SFMTA submitted memorandums several years ago to the Planning Department asserting that the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) did not require an additional EIR to be submitted, and the city agency agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;By definition, opponents of the project did not.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;J.R. Eppler, president of the Potrero Boosters Neighborhood Association, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/muni-t-third-loop-alleviate-overcrowding-simplify-travel/&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the San Francisco &lt;em&gt;Examiner&lt;/em&gt; that significant residential development in the Dogpatch neighborhood necessitated further environmental study. He also argued that because loop itself lacked any stop for passengers to board, there may be dangers to pedestrian safety supporting his preference to relocate the loop several blocks South.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Malia Cohen also told the &lt;em&gt;Examiner&lt;/em&gt; that she was sensitive to local residents’ concerns and would help advocate for the alternative loop location.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The appellate court found that the 1998 EIR still met substantial standards of evidence—“that the original environmental document retains some informational value.” The court considered SFMTA’s memorandums to the Planning Department from 2012 and 2014 as satisfactory signs of “informational value.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The decision affirms under the &lt;em&gt;San Mateo Gardens&lt;/em&gt; substantial evidence standard that agencies may continue to rely on previous Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs), regardless of age, so long as they retain information value,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hklaw.com/publications/Reliance-on-1998-EIR-Under-CEQA-Upheld-Based-on-Substantial-Evidence-12-20-2016/&quot;&gt;writes Jennifer Hernandez&lt;/a&gt;, an attorney at Holland &amp;amp; Knight. The firm is known for releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hklaw.com/publications/In-the-Name-of-the-Environment-Litigation-Abuse-Under-CEQA-August-2015/&quot;&gt;numerous studies&lt;/a&gt; on the use/abuse of CEQA to suppress the construction of infill development and transit infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We were advocating for moving the loop several blocks further south, so that there would be stops serving Dogpatch,” Eppler wrote in an email. “We're also concerned about potential reductions in service to Bayview. We were advocating for &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; T-expansion, and smarter, modern, routing of transit.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The decision may set precedent unfavorable to other appeals under CEQA, such as the recent appeal of a project at &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/11/in-stunner-city-strikes-down-major-mission-project/&quot;&gt;1515 South Van Ness Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, in which opponents claimed the Eastern Neighborhood Plan EIR did not address the new dwelling units’ risk of displacement effects. Outgoing Supervisor David Campos led the Board’s unanimous vote to uphold the appeal, despite his observation that the appeal was not yet legally sound.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Last night at the Second Act Gallery, friends embraced; smiles abounded; outside, some gathered in circular formations to pass around weed and pizza. Oh, yes, and there was music.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Second Act, a stalwart of San Francisco’s experimental and electronic music scenes, now shares its home with another longtime Haight institution, The Bookbinder, which is setting up &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoodline.com/2016/10/booksmith-expanding-into-second-act-space-with-the-bindery&quot;&gt;The Bindery&lt;/a&gt; in the gallery's front space. On this night, musicians and fans gathered to pay homage to the music of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/in-memoriam-jsun-adrian-mccarty/&quot;&gt;Jsun McCarty&lt;/a&gt;, with all proceeds going to memorialize another victim of the Oakland Ghost Ship Fire, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/in-memoriam-micah-danemayer/&quot;&gt;Micah Danemayer&lt;/a&gt;. Organizers estimated $300 raised for a scholarship fund in Danemayer’s name at his alma mater, the Massachusetts College of Art and Design.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Northern California noise connoisseurs Xome (Sacramento) and Tralphaz (Oakland) headlined with a collaborative set lasting no more than five minutes. The sheer auditory onslaught they delivered beggars description. Having forgotten my earplugs, it should suffice to say that I was able to enjoy the sonic evocations of a satanic root canal in Chernobyl with perfect clarity from outside.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Everyone’s here. People I haven’t seen in ages,” one attendee told me. “It feels like a family reunion.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the several dozen people packed into a small room (with multiple modes of egress, mind you) did make it feel like an intimate gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/waxy-tomb&quot;&gt;Waxy Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, the electronic project of Julia Litman-Cleper, opened the night with something between a sceance and an out-of-body experience. Litman-Cleper wove an auditory maze of high-pitched screeches, some feeling barely on the edge of human perception, over an ever-shifting foundation of factory-like rhythms evoking steel mills and broken dial-up modems.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the night’s biggest surprise was &lt;a href=&quot;http://resipiscent.com/midmight/&quot;&gt;Midmight&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious semi-duo of sound wizards fearlessly toeing the line between deadpan anti-performance and austere, hyper-focused experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mightmight’s leader sat cross-legged on the floor, shielding their face with a massive lampshade of a hat as they cranked out earsplitting textures and pre-recorded samples. At times soothing and mysterious, at others violently loud, a certain levity came about as a second performer dribbled a basketball across the floor. It wasn’t quite clear they were part of the act until they joined the mayhem at a table in the corner equipped with electronic doodads.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Local synth-master &lt;a href=&quot;https://branpos.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Bran(...)Pos&lt;/a&gt; led his new trio with Matt Ingalls and Hans Grusel, dubbed “I Should Have Cut The Eyes Different,” through an equally spectacular but wildly uncategorizable set. While Mr. (…)Pos conducted from behind a makeshift tympani, his fellow musicians provided a live score via woodwinds and keyboards to an eerie, unsettling collage of Christmas cartoons. At several points, the audience seemed unsure if it was time to applaud until more atonal chirping or distorted samples of baroque music interrupted their confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;And what’s left to be said of Xome and Tralphaz? Nothing, really. Their performance was as beautiful and cathartic as one can hope for, a whirlwind run through any and all existent pitches, with unpredictable dynamics eschewing emotion and melody with zero respect for the attendees’ eardrums.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Micah and Jsun would be proud.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Unlike most performances reviewed here, last night’s concert is unique in that it was filmed in its entirety for your viewing pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlaef.org/resources/&quot;&gt;California Renters Legal Advocacy &amp;amp; Education Fund&lt;/a&gt; (CaRLA) hosted a panel discussion on intersectional justice issues arising from the state's housing shortage. An estimated 130 people attended.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, zoning restrictions and requiring multiple approvals harms affordability and increases segregation,&quot; said Brian Hanlon, co-founder of CaRLA. Mr. Hanlon gives us the scoop on the four panelists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As a scholar at UCLA, Michael Lens' research interests vary, but he published a major paper about the effects of land use policies on economic segregation. Professor Lens understands that saying no to housing means saying yes to segregation and denying people access to opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kate Downing not only co-founded a successful YIMBY organization in Palo Alto, she was a former Planning Commissioner who regularly critiqued Palo Alto's exclusionary land use practices, which drove low- and middle-income people away from the city.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As a long-time affordable housing practitioner and now Chief of Staff to the Mayor of Oakland, Tomiquia Moss is uniquely qualified to discuss the effects of the housing shortage in Oakland and the politics of possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Before leading California's Department of Housing and Community Development, Ben Metcalf was an Assistant Secretary at HUD and worked at BRIDGE Housing. Ben understands which legislative changes at the state level could spur housing construction and ease the housing shortage, as well as the complicated politics that have thwarted past efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Californians eager to see additional funds for low-income housing may soon see relief from a proposal to fund such programs with additional tax revenue levied on those with significant real estate assets. Specifically, Assemblymember David Chiu (D – San Francisco) has proposed ending the state’s mortgage interest deduction for owners with a second home.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Chiu’s bill, AB 71, would direct new revenue to fund existing tax credits for the construction of low-income housing. Dubbed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://asmdc.org/members/a17/news-room/press-releases/assemblymember-david-chiu-joins-colleagues-to-announce-bills-to-address-affordable-housing-crisis&quot;&gt;Bring California Home Act&lt;/a&gt;, the bill, co-authored by Assemblymembers Ting (D – SF) and Mullin (D – San Mateo) would bring an additional $300 million to the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The bill comes as part of a multi-pronged set of proposals aimed at easing the state's housing woes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Because there's no one solution to the housing crisis, we put forward this package of solutions,” Chiu said in a briefphone interview. “[The package will] increase funding, incentivize and streamline housing creation, and enforce existing housing laws. AB 71 will address the funding, so that's the context this fits into.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The state’s mortgage interest deduction represents California’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lao.ca.gov/handouts/State_Admin/2013/Housing-Tax-Expenditure-031813.pdf&quot;&gt;largest investment in housing&lt;/a&gt;, at a cost of $4.6 billion in 2010. The nonpartisan &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/options-reform-deduction-home-mortgage-interest-1&quot;&gt;Tax Policy Center&lt;/a&gt; think-tank found that the federal tax benefit costs the U.S. Treasury nearly $95.5 billion per year, disproportionately benefiting the top 20% of incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though Democrats have since seized a supermajority in the state legislature, California Republicans are not fond of Chiu’s proposal. Assemblymember Marc Steinorth (R – Rancho Cucamonga), leader of the California GOP Caucus, released a statement opposing AB 71, stating in part: “The plan introduced today is simply paying lip service and fails to address the very root cause of the housing crisis we are currently suffering: a lack of housing supply available to first-time homebuyers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Governor Jerry Brown’s proposal to streamline the construction of new housing failed to gain enough support from the legislature, due in no small part to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ad40.asmrc.org/featured-news/assemblyman-steinorth-says-sacramento%E2%80%99s-newly-unveiled-housing-plan-won%E2%80%99t-resolve&quot;&gt;GOP opposition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Steinorth is the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB53&quot;&gt;AB 53&lt;/a&gt;, the Homeowners Savings Account bill, encouraging new homebuyers to save money in a tax-free account to cover the down payment and closing costs of a first-time home purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I lift my lamp beside the golden door!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;—Emma Lazarus, &quot;The New Colossus&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;So you live in a liberal enclave in a blue state, one of the big progressive cities. One of those places where you're more likely to see a Sumatran tiger than someone who openly backed Donald Trump. One of those Sanctuary Cities. You want to do something, but well, locally it's already about as progressive as it's possible to get... right?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Well, no. There is still plenty of injustice right here to fight, and I want to focus on one of the biggest: housing. Housing prices here are doing real, serious, ongoing harm to local residents, especially minority communities that are being driven out of neighborhoods they've lived in for decades. Landlords and property owners have soaked up most of the riches generated by the tech booms of the past thirty years. 
Meanwhile, the working classes and the poor are being pushed further and further out, forced to make longer and longer commutes, which, besides being devastating to personal and family life, damage the environment and increase strain on our infrastructure. Others are living out of their cars, or on friends’ couches, or in unsafe housing like &lt;a href=&quot;http://wearyourvoicemag.com/more/social-justice/housing-crisis-not-ravers-blame-oakland-fire&quot;&gt;the Oakland Ghost Ship&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But there's another group of people harmed by the housing crisis: the people who can't come here. This isn't only about economic opportunity, though the economic damage caused by the inability of people from high unemployment regions to migrate to regions with a labor shortage should not be underestimated. The fact is, Trump’s election has unleashed some very ugly forces. The Klan is on the march. Swastikas are cropping up. There has been a surge in racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and transphobic violence—verbal and physical assaults, arson, beatings, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Slaying-fueled-by-hate-unsettles-El-Sobrante-10659150.php&quot;&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In short, the forces of bigotry and white supremacy see Trump's victory as their victory. The suicide, homelessness, and abuse rates that queer and especially trans youth suffer are already national scandals. Under President Trump and Vice President Pence, things will get worse for them. And if Trump moves forward with his “deportation force”, immigrant communities across the country will be threatened.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;So we need to provide a shelter from the storm that's coming. We cannot retreat into our enclaves and pull up our drawbridges. No, we need to be the safe spaces that his supporters mock. Trump accuses us of being Sanctuary Cities? Well, so be it. We should wear that badge with Pride. Let us be the shining city on the hill, a beacon to the oppressed. Let us offer a haven to the victims of the coming persecutions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But we cannot do that if they have no place to live once they arrive. Everyone knows San Francisco's housing prices are outrageous, but the fact is housing is increasingly unaffordable throughout the country, especially in our would-be Sanctuary Cities. New York, DC, LA, Seattle, and Portland are all being severely affected by rising housing prices.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;So how the hell is the trans kid in Oklahoma who got kicked out by their parents going to live here when the rent for a studio is over $2,000 a month? How is the Muslim family that no longer feels safe in Tennessee going to find a home in the Bay when virtually all of the new housing being constructed has only one or two bedrooms? What good is it to the undocumented immigrant that our city claims to be a sanctuary if she cannot afford to pay the rent without working eighty hours a week?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It's great to be nice to the people Trump is beating up, but how can we claim to be welcoming when none of those people can actually afford to live here? No, if we are truly to be Sanctuary Cities, we must build far more housing than we have in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;So enough with the contempt for newcomers, the naive fear of &quot;Manhattanization&quot;, the coded pleas to &quot;preserve neighborhood character.&quot; Enough of the soft racism of gentrification, but also enough pretending that gentrification is a matter of personal choice rather than of brute economics. It's time to stop making excuses, and to dismantle the NIMBY power in our communities.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We cannot be the ones to throw up walls. Let us lift the lamp beside the golden door, throw open our golden gates, and show America what a true sanctuary looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richard Mehlinger is a software engineer (yes, one of those) living in Sunnyvale.

				&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Metropolitan Observer&lt;/em&gt; is delving into the world of print publishing with one of the most exciting comic book projects this ragtag team of political nerds could imagine. A quick recap:&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Less than three years ago, local journalist Kim-Mai Cutler blew Bay Area housing politics wide open with her incendiary essay, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/&quot;&gt;How Burrowing Owls Lead to Vomiting Anarchists&lt;/a&gt;. Cutler sought to redraw alliances where she saw petty, shallow class-warfare rhetoric, and did the math to show how California landowners would profit from the latest employment boom regardless of how much new housing was built. Her sharp, even-handed analysis also called upon free-market faithfuls to consider the plight of those most vulnerable to being displaced, for whom market forces offer no immediate relief.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Thus the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfyimby.org/&quot;&gt;SF YIMBY&lt;/a&gt; Party was born. A formidable alliance of renters &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; renters, defying easy categorization with a broad multipartisan swath of support, the Yes In My Back Yard coalition could hardly have framed the problem so effectively without Cutler’s leadership. The region suffers from a raw &lt;em&gt;housing shortage&lt;/em&gt;, and restricting housing options only helps those who already own rapidly-appreciating real estate equity. Kim-Mai has worked tirelessly to make this crystal-clear for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Enter Oakland-based cartoonist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krustywheatfield.com/&quot;&gt;Kelsey Westphal&lt;/a&gt;, who we hired to draw a handful of political comics. Readers expressed delight upon our publication of her much-anticiapted “Atherton Police Blotter” comic (reprinted below), so we decided to get ambitious. Kelsey will burn the midnight oil to produce a graphic novel adaptation of Cutler’s essay, with a planned release date in March 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We know this is ambitious, but we think it’s worth it, and we think our readers will too. You can contribute to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sfbamo/burrowing-owls-vomiting-anarchists-and-sf-housing&quot;&gt;our Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; up through January 14th. Artists have bills to pay, as do printers and Post Office employees.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Nothing is free in this life, but right now, we have all have this chance to give the gift of knowledge. That has been our goal since day one.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Jsun McCarty has been another hard loss for me to process. Out of respect and deference to his family, I refrained from eulogizing him until after his memorial service. And, my goodness, what a memorial service—loved ones from far and wide gathered to spin his favorite records, share stories, and gorge on mac and cheese. Just like Jsun would have wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;(Please consider donating to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youcaring.com/genemccartycolleenmccartyimmediatefamily-719048?fb_action_ids=1693271440914299&amp;amp;fb_action_types=youcaringcom%3Ashare&quot;&gt;this fund&lt;/a&gt; to help his family with travel and other ancillary costs.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Several days after the Ghost Ship tragedy, Jsun appeared in a waking dream to Michael Daddona, his roommate and bandmate of 12 years. He sent his love and regards to everyone, but with one catch: make sure not to misspell his name. It’s Jsun.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Jsun was an artistic genius with the humility to constantly reject such accolades. (I had no idea what a brilliant painter he was until some of his stunning canvasses were displayed at his memorial.) His primary concern was always making sure everyone else was having a good time. Perhaps even more fondly than his performances, I’ll always remember sitting outside with him between acts at various concerts, listening to his stories of driving for six hours from his childhood home in Iowa to see Slayer in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;He radiated a gentle, gregarious kindness in his personal demeanor, but his musical performances were anything but. Jsun designed all the visual artwork for the three-piece industrial-noise group Styrofoam Sanchez (later dubbed Coral Remains), even authoring a stunning comic book narrating the lyrics of their monumental LP/DVD release, &lt;em&gt;Empire Underwater.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A Sanchez performance was not one to be missed. The group was notorious for making a mess in every performance space, mostly from the ritual destruction of the homemade Styrofoam masks covering their faces like a dystopian nuclear fungus. (They were just as notorious for meticulously cleaning up their messes.) When I last saw them, the trio had recruited at least a half-dozen audience members to wear full-bodied Styrofoam suits and mosh aggressively in the crowd, resulting in a furious-yet-mirthful Styrofoam fight.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;His vision was uncompromising and unrivaled in its depth and detail; his gentle spirit is a constant reminder to embrace our fellow humans ever more earnestly.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Some things never change: for Dorothy Walker, that includes fighting for Berkeley to embrace change. After leading a largely successful city taskforce to desegregate Berkeley’s public schools in the early 1960s, Ms. Walker has hardly rested on her laurels. Instead, she has devoted herself to advocating for a more diverse city overall. The Sisyphean resistance she’s received from the city’s suburban scrooges, even an ostensibly “progressive” coalition originally formed to strengthen tenant protections, would be enough to drive any normal person away.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Not Dorothy Walker. The 86-year-old’s experience also includes chairing the city’s Planning Commission, serving as the founding president of the American Planners Association, and co-founding the local environmental non-profit Livable Berkeley. She remains just as active in her retirement years.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When we met at a local café, I remembered Ms. Walker’s assurance that she’d be easy to recognize—“I’ll be the oldest woman in the room.” As expected, the first woman I approached was not her. Nor the second one.  Finally, she waved me down from a table in the back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorothy Walker, present-day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We had initially planned our meeting to discuss a letter to Berkeley’s City Council she had sent in February, in response to a special meeting on housing policy convened by then-Mayor Tom Bates. When the full context of her deeper frustrations set in, our meeting turned into a full-fledged interview.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Walker’s thesis is simple: Berkeley needs more housing. More than that, it needs a significant paradigm shift to address a shortage decades in the making. The City of Berkeley &lt;a href=&quot;http://webserver.ci.berkeley.ca.us/uploadedFiles/Housing/Level_3_-_General/COBHousingElementAdopted12-18-01.pdf&quot;&gt;saw a net gain&lt;/a&gt; of merely 541 housing units between 1980 and 2000. The city even saw a net decrease of units during the 1980s largely due to a loss of secondary units and owner-occupied conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Her letter puts it more diplomatically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While Berkeley prides itself on being a progressive city, it has continually empowered those whose housing needs have already been met, while making it extremely difficult and expensive to create any new housing, resulting in an increasingly less diverse and more privileged population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Berkeley saw its most dramatic increase in housing construction between 1960 and 1975, largely by apartments replacing single-family homes. To protect more houses from demolition, the city’s voters passed the Neighborhood Preservation Ordinance in 1973, which required a Conditional Use Permit for “absolutely everything,” as Walker puts it. Though initially well-intentioned, Walker describes the Ordinance as an ultimately reactionary policy borne out of an alliance between anti-eviction and rent control advocates with wealthier, landowning “neighborhood preservationists.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The left got in bed with the right, and they’re still together,” Walker says. One can see clear evidence of this in the city’s latest election: newly-elected Mayor Jesse Arreguin, touting the credentials of a “progressive” with a bevy of left-leaning endorsements, was also supported by Shirley Dean, a conservative homeowner from the city’s posh hillside area who presided as mayor over the de facto building moratorium during most of the ‘80s and ‘90s. In her public endorsement, Dean &lt;a href=&quot;http://berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2016-10-14/article/45010&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;There is no denying we have a need for more housing as well as revenue to help us out of the economic hole that's been growing over the last decade. Solutions aren't easy. However, there is absolutely no need to destroy the community that attracted us to living here in the first place. But given that Berkeley is only about eight square miles and is already the most dense [sic] community in the East Bay, it is essential that we approach development in a thoughtful, managed way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Until this month, the Council held a 6-3 majority of a so-called “moderate,” majority, inverted in this year’s election largely thanks to high-profile progressive endorsements from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Even then, Walker laments, the City Council under Bates made mostly weak, symbolic gestures to address the local and regional housing shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Their meeting ended with them saying, ‘and we have to do this all while protecting the neighborhoods.’ Well, they might as well have cancelled out everything they talked about before,” she says. “You can talk about building near transit all you want, but if you protect some residential neighborhoods from seeing any change, other neighborhoods bear the brunt of it. That is a major equity issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ms. Walker’s letter to the council reiterates policy she has been advocating for since the late 1960s: banning single-story commercial buildings and encouraging the construction of a minimum of 4 residential stories atop existing retail. Her letter cites the completion of the North Shattuck Safeway grocery store, and the resistance to dense development around the Ashby BART station, as key examples of Berkeley’s resistance to urban growth.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-story commercial buildings (and one two-story building) at the intersection of College &amp;amp; Claremont Avenues on the Berkeley/Oakland border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“In the 1960s, you had these Model City programs, designed to empower minorities, especially African-Americans, to take control of their neighborhoods and say what they wanted there,” Walker tells me. (Indeed, Ms. Walker &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2011/03/30/city-council-honors-planning-pioneer-dorothy-walker/&quot;&gt;organized&lt;/a&gt; adamant opposition against plans to tear down Ashby Avenue for a freeway.) “It seems to me that more affluent, white homeowners took ahold of that idea and felt very justified in fighting to preserve what they had.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It was an old pattern she had seen before, during her efforts to draw more inclusive school district boundaries. “What I found was that some people were willing to bus kids around to desegregate schools, but they weren’t willing to desegregate the neighborhoods themselves,” she said. Additionally, she saw many white leftists suddenly sending their children to private schools, “because their curriculums are more progressive, supposedly. But the result was setting desegregation back significantly.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Her next move to desegregate &lt;em&gt;neighborhoods themselves&lt;/em&gt; struck a nerve that is still sensitive today. “When I was on the Planning Commission, I put forward a proposal to rezone the entire city for mixed-use,” she says, briefly beaming before adding: “as you might imagine, that didn’t go over well.” 
While she largely succeeded in redrawing school district boundaries to desegregate the school system, she has not yet succeeded in redrawing the city’s zoning code to desegregate the city itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In her letter, Walker adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Not unlike the now-discredited racial covenants that assured that only white people could live east of Grove Street (now Martin Luther King, Jr. Way), zoning restricted large areas of the City for single family use only—the most expensive kind of housing…Some of the most ardent opponents of new housing live in these protected neighborhoods. They may not be gated, but many of these parts of Berkeley are car-dependent suburban enclaves of increasingly wealthy residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Indeed, not only is Berkeley’s zoning similar to racial covenants; historical evidence shows that the city’s early zoning laws were enacted explicitly for the purposes of racial segregation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In 1916, Berkeley became one of the first cities, along with New York and Los Angeles, to establish a zoning code. It was the first in the country to zone one of its neighborhoods (Elmwood / Claremont in the east) for single-family use. One of the ordinance’s co-authors, Charles H. Cheney, explained its purpose in a letter: single-family zoning “tends to guide and automatically regulate the class of citizens who are settling here,” particularly in order to “prohibit occupation of land by Negroes or Asiatics.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In a civic bulletin written the previous year to promote his proposals, Cheney observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Chinese laundries have always been unwelcome and unprofitable neighbors and the California courts have for many years been dealing with laws against them or restricting them to certain localities…. The location of one laundry near Dwight Way station by permission of the city council a few years ago deteriorated that neighborhood until only negroes and Orientals would rent the nearby buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ms. Walker’s description of zoning as a policy to “increase segregation by exacerbating concentration by affluence” alludes to this dark past without drawing an explicit connection. Instead, it pulls a quiet counterweight to comments from preservationist homeowners bemoaning “greedy developers” and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2016-06-10/article/44573?headline=Keeping-on-Keepin-On-even-in-the-summertime--Becky-O-Malley&quot;&gt;dismissing new apartments&lt;/a&gt; as being “designed for cramming in as many students who want to party it up without dorm rules as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But even Mayor Arreguin, Walker says, despite being reluctantly branded as a “slow-growth” politician, can’t deny reality. “He fought tooth and nail against the Downtown Plan before it passed in 2010. His &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenbelt.org/blog/examiner-com-measure-r-bad-policy-berkeley/&quot;&gt;Measure R in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, co-authored by [now-Councilmember] Sophie Hahn, which would have scrapped much of the downtown plan, lost by over 70%. It lost in every precinct. But then, in his first campaign speech this year, he said he’d preserve the Downtown Plan. So he must know there’s a very clear mandate for the city to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ms. Walker soon hopes to deliver a more refined petition before the new Council urging a greater commitment to mixed-use density.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“They say they’re progressive,” she remarks, “so we need to hold them to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Last night, local residents met at the Forest Hill Christian Church for an informational session on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/forest-hill-neighbors-oppose-150-unit-senior-housing-proposal/&quot;&gt;proposed 150-unit apartment building&lt;/a&gt; for low-income seniors. The non-profit developer Christian Church Homes, along with a representative from the mayor's Department of Homelessness &amp;amp; Supportive Services, fielded questions from an often hostile audience over a tense two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Webmaster Sonja Trauss and I reported the meeting live on Twitter, so rather than recap at length, I thought it best to offer highlights from our play-by-play coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Some important fact checks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.curbed.com/2016/11/18/13681294/forest-hill-sf-senior-housing-joe-bravo&quot;&gt;Joe Bravo&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer and landlord who has &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfgov.org/bdappeal/sites/default/files/Item%204,%20Jurisdiction%20Request%20@%20665%20San%20Jose%20Avenue_2.pdf&quot;&gt;evicted tenants&lt;/a&gt; in the Mission, objected to one comment pointing out the neighborhood's history of discrimination. &quot;Not since the '30s,&quot; he scoffed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outsidelands.org/sw5.php&quot;&gt;In 1957&lt;/a&gt;, the iconic baseball player Willie Mays almost had his home purchase revoked in Forest Hill after furious opposition from nearby residents. After racist threats were thrown through their window, Mays and his wife sold their house at 175 Miraloma and returned to New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many neighbors objected to the proposed project being &quot;too tall&quot; and &quot;a giant in the neighborhood.&quot; At six stories, it would be far less of a giant than the ten-story &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outsidelands.org/sw5.php&quot;&gt;Avalon Sunset Towers&lt;/a&gt; just a few blocks away.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco’s Council of Community Housing Organizations (CCHO) is against housing, period. That much was made clear when Directors Peter Cohen and Fernando Martí publicly opposed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socketsite.com/archives/2016/11/macro-development-of-micro-units-closer-to-reality-in-western-soma.html&quot;&gt;student housing project at 333 12th Street&lt;/a&gt; that invoked California’s State Density Bonus. The project was able to increase the total number of housing units by 35% in exchange for including units price-indexed for Very Low-Income households.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Stated more plainly: self-appointed “affordable housing activists” lobbied for less housing because the balance of income levels living in the building mattered more to them than having more homes, period. They prefer nothing be built rather than anything short of their version of perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;CCHO’s priorities were made even clearer in a recent press release, where Cohen and Martí themselves point out that the net number of Below Market Rate (BMR) units did not change. The organization bemoans that 333 12th Street “added two full floors and 52 additional market-rate units per the state density bonus, [and] effectively reduced the Inclusionary Housing obligation from 18% down to 13%.” Under the original proposal, the project would have included 27 units permanently affordable to Very Low-Income households, out of 148. The project approved by the Planning Commission last week increases the total number to 200, while maintaining 27 units at Below Market Rate prices.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;What they fail to mention—but we did mention, because we did our research—was that the project was not required to include any on-site BMR units &lt;em&gt;at all.&lt;/em&gt; So long as the units remain leased to a 501(c)(3) educational non-profit, city law would exempt the developer from any requirement for lower-income housing within the same building. If, however, such a lease were to end, the 18% allotment required by local zoning would be reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It is a dangerous precedent that takes the City of San Francisco backwards on more than a decade of affordable housing policy,” Cohen writes. Sorry, it is not “dangerous” for a city to finally comply with state law.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We have &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/editorial-questioning-priorities-in-the-affordable-housing-community/&quot;&gt;previously criticized&lt;/a&gt; CCHO for stating that their top priority is to tax new development as much as possible to pay for permanently price-indexed dwelling units. They put it in more appealing terms, to “capture the windfall profits resulting from increased land values.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Yes, raising the cost of housing for future tenants matters more to the Council of Community Housing Organizations than &lt;em&gt;providing more housing.&lt;/em&gt; Mr. Cohen’s predecessor at CCHO, Calvin Welch, still had the gall to &lt;a href=&quot;http://48hills.org/2016/10/04/obamas-supply-side-toolkit-attacks-local-housing-policy/&quot;&gt;criticize the Obama Administration’s “Housing Toolkit” publication&lt;/a&gt; for neglecting to discuss the paucity of federal subsidies for affordable housing (as though local policy weren’t orthogonal to Congress funding HUD). Why, then, would CCHO not list such policies as their top priority?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;333 12th Street (source: Panoramic Interests)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Zac Shore, representative of the 333 12th Street developer Panoramic Interests, told us &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.aspx&quot;&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt; that the State Density Bonus mitigated the financial risk imposed by higher BMR requirements citywide. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/san-francisco-approves-200-units-with-state-density-bonus/&quot;&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; we conducted earlier this year found fewer units—both at market-rate and below—entering the entitlement process after the passage of Proposition C, which doubled the requirement to 25% of total units.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Greater density makes subsidized housing more feasible, particularly when only the future residents of new development are paying for the subsidy. If this were not the case, Supervisors Peskin and Kim would not have needed to negotiate grandfather clauses for specific projects already underway when crafting their referendum.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;CCHO does not deny that their sole focus is on the &lt;em&gt;percentage&lt;/em&gt; of permanently price-indexed housing built in the city, rather than the total number.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Even that stated intention rests on shaky ground. When San Francisco proposed its own version of the State Density Bonus law, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoodline.com/2015/11/city-planners-push-plan-for-more-density-affordability-across-sf-neighborhoods&quot;&gt;Affordable Housing Bonus Program&lt;/a&gt; (AHBP), CCHO mounted &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbarf.tumblr.com/post/137295902175/sf-fauxgressives-dont-get-deferred-rewards-or&quot;&gt;vigorous opposition&lt;/a&gt;, despite a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; allotment of Below Market Rate units than state law or the Western SoMa plan required. Mr. Welch, ever a paragon of self-awareness, &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/01/sf-delays-controversial-housing-law-amidst-opposition-cries-of-ethnic-cleansing/&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; the policy as a form of genocide.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mr. Cohen, who, according to public records, recently converted his dwelling unit from a Tenancy-In-Common to a Condominium, would ostensibly feel better about himself if there are more lower-income people filling out income certification paperwork every year. How generous of us to require those holding on to their lottery-allotted housing to continuously prove their poverty. Those caught in the middle, who neither qualify for low-income housing lotteries or are able to afford market prices, are screwed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The crux of the problem is that CCHO fights for higher percentages and lower net unit counts because they believe that market-rate housing is &lt;em&gt;the problem&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;part of&lt;/em&gt; (not the entirety of) the toolkit we need to fix our urban housing crisis. CCHO published these views in their report on “The Filtering Fallacy,” in which they attempt to show that market-rate housing will never meet the city’s raw supply shortage to a degree that would help the most vulnerable in our society. Rather than summarize it, I’ll simply include it below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;embed src=&quot; http://www.sfccho.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Filtering-Fallacy-Infographic-Final-Web.pdf&quot; width=&quot;800px&quot; height=&quot;2100px&quot; /&gt;


    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the worst fallacy is to assume you have found a relevant fallacy at all. CCHO set out to refute a claim that absolutely no one has made: the idea that more market-rate construction &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt; will give the Bay Area’s poor and middle-class more options &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; is, of course, ridiculous. The City Controller recommended an 18% requirement for a reason: it will produce more affordable housing than the current 25%. CCHO does not care to refute this claim; it simply isn’t their top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;However, the opposite scenario is also not true: there is no &lt;em&gt;excess&lt;/em&gt; of private development cushioning the nouveau-riche while actively pricing everyone else out.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;You, reader, can do the homework on this. I’m exhausted, and don’t want to argue with you time and time again. That’s something the folks at CCHO would do. You can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.aspx&quot;&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3470&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;from the Legislative Analyst’s Office, or not. You, like CCHO, have the freedom to ignore information at your will.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At the very least, perhaps consider the counterfactual: if there were more than enough supply of market-rate development, we would see the city’s vacancy rate rise before rents showed any change. San Francisco’s vacancy rate is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deptofnumbers.com/rent/california/san-francisco/#vacancy_rate&quot;&gt;a historic low&lt;/a&gt; of 2.68%, less than half of the national average.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;If fewer people were clamoring to bid on a place to rest their weary head, you would expect to see more vacant units waiting on the market for a bidder. Vexingly, people still want to live in the city. (I live in the East Bay, the better part of the bay, so personally, I don’t get it—but who am I to judge?)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Of course, the regional and statewide shortage of urban housing seems beyond dire. How can we imagine it ever getting better? Well, it might help if CCHO did not continue to actively participate in slowing down the process they then criticize as being too slow to help anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Here, I contend, is where the so-called “activist” establishment must bring their priorities in line with generations who will have to live with the consequences of their policies for far longer. Misanthropy will never make any city more livable.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Dorothy King has been homeless. She has lived in warehouses. Today, she runs her family business and wants her community to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;These noble intentions were misunderstood last week after the owner of Everett &amp;amp; Jones Barbecue held a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/12/06/everett-jones-owner-says-oakland-venue-next-to-restaurant-poses-hazard-like-ghost-ship/&quot;&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; warning officials over potential fire hazards at the illegal live/work artist warehouse next door, known as the Salt Lick Collective. In the wake of the tragic Ghost Ship fire, with Oakland’s arts community reeling from grief and shock, King’s announcement was met with furious backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This morning, local artists and restauranteurs stood together at a press conference at the Everett &amp;amp; Jones location in Jack London Square to announce their newfound unity. On Saturday, Everett &amp;amp; Jones will host a catered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/1729224307396666/&quot;&gt;benefit concert&lt;/a&gt; to raise funds for fire safety upgrades, in an effort to prevent displacement throughout Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Some panelists were on the verge of tears as they described the slew of racist emails the restaurant received, which eventually brought the neighbors to meet and collaborate. Nina Moore, Mrs. King’s daughter, explained that the trauma of reading those racial slurs reminded her of the presidential election, and made her feel that Oakland was no longer a safe haven from bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Uncle Bobby” Johnson, the uncle of Oscar Grant, told the audience how he remained steadfast in the face of negative comments after his nephew was murdered by BART Police.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Those divisive comments… they didn’t work,” he declared. “Look at this table now. They brought unity.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;photo-with-caption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/east-bay-bbq-joint-will-raise-funds-for-warehouse-fire-safety/ej2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oakland resident and Salt Lick resident Sam Lefebvre discusses displacement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We realized we had the same goals,” said Sam Lefebvre, a journalist and artist who lives at the Salt Lick. “Housing people safely.”  Lefebvre worked with Everett &amp;amp; Jones to book the concert, and is working with volunteer contractor Ken Houston of the East Oakland Beautification Committee to upgrade his home.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Before Mrs. King arrived, Houston had stood in front of news cameras with Councilmember Noel Gallo, whose district encompasses the former Ghost Ship warehouse. “I don’t care if you’ve lived here your whole life or you just moved here,” he said. “If you’re in Oakland, you’re an Oaklander. Stand up for your city.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Displacement has been a decades-long process in Oakland,” Lefebvre later said. “One that has disproportionately impacted People of Color. No discussion of artists here today can leave that out.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;During her speech, Mrs. King brandished a large, translucent plastic key, a ceremonial “key to the city” given to her by former Mayor Jean Quan. “At first, I thought this key opened nothing. Now this key will open the door to affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Local artist BG Anaraki, who had engaged in a shouting match with Ms. Moore at the previous press conference, held hands with King and Moore as he described “the most beautiful experience of my life” when meeting with the owners. The neighbors quite literally broke bread with each other to settle tensions and plan a common path forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oakland artist BG Anaraki reads the names of the 36 who perished in the Ghost Ship fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“When Mrs. King held me as I cried, my tears were not only for my friends—they were tears of joy,” Anaraki said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Anaraki also urged the audience to consider the Ghost Ship tragedy’s impact on individual mental health. “To all my friends out there, if you see me, don’t tell me you saw me on TV. Instead, ask me if I’ve taken my pills that day. I’m not good at remembering…Reach out to your friends on medication, and ask their consent to bring up the same question.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“BG, I’m so proud of you,” Ms. Moore said as the press conference neared its end. She gripped his outstretched hand, a solemn Mrs. King between them. “Whenever you need me—I’m here for you, to take that call.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Anaraki will be performing at the restaurant on Saturday as Braingoat. He will be joined by hardcore punk band No Babies, noise-rock group Ugly, the free-jazz duo Black Spirituals, and local soul singer Dyson. The following day, Everett &amp;amp; Jones will hold a vigil for the victims of the Ghost Ship fire, evoking the city’s former motto: &lt;em&gt;Love Life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;By a unanimous vote last night, Oakland’s City Council passed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://oakland.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2896460&amp;amp;GUID=86EECCD2-2A43-4DCC-8EC3-C685F8219879&amp;amp;Options=&amp;amp;Search=&quot;&gt;45-day moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on the conversion of Single Room Occupancy hotels (SROs) into other uses.  Council chambers were flooded with supporters of the legislation during the special meeting, with many items pertaining to the December 2nd warehouse fire that claimed 36 lives. City Council also renewed the citywide state of emergency declared after the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The emergency ordinance, introduced by Council President Lynette Gibson McElhaney, will be reviewed when the council returns from recess in January. Councilmember-At-Large Rebecca Kaplan further added that she planned to introduce legislation to protect tenants in illegal live/work spaces similar to the Ghost Ship after the recess.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;SROs, a common form of low-rent housing sought by many either homeless and housing-insecure residents, have been the center of local controversy as Oakland’s rents continue to skyrocket. Having lost nearly half of its SRO units since 2004, the city has seen a particular focus on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/last-days-at-downtown-oaklands-hotel-travelers/Content?oid=4799815&quot;&gt;Hotel Travelers&lt;/a&gt;, a downtown SRO building whose new ownership appears to be eager to evict long-term tenants in favor of more profitable ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Danny Haber has earned notoriety with his holding company The Negev, which recently purchased Hotel Travelers, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antievictionmap.com/danny-haber-and-alon-gutman/&quot;&gt;evicting low-income tenants&lt;/a&gt; in many properties on both sides of the bay. Orlando Chavez, a resident of the Travelers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DarwinBondGraha/status/808894790024777730&quot;&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; that most tenants had already been driven out by harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many speakers at the meeting supported extending SRO protection for an even longer period of time. “SROs are the last line of defense against homelessness,” one woman said. “I want to express my support for this measure and point out that the decrease in SROs corresponds to the increase in homelessness nationally.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;James Vann, representing the Oakland Tenants Union, testified that his group supported the ordinance. Further, he added, “Relocation payments should be made to any people who are found to have to move after they've become permanent residents.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“A city is a place of people all living together in different classes. A suburb is where only people of one class live,” said Judy Elkan of the Mary Weather Gallery. “Oakland is a city; we should be an example to the world of how to stop homelessness.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The most direct appeal of the night came from another man who identified himself as a current resident of a local SRO: “SROs are a fantastic place to live if they're managed well.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;For the next 45 days, the city of Oakland categorically agrees with his statement.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;You read this morning’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/op-ed-poor-housing-and-lackluster-broadband-access-in-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; by our webmaster Sonja Trauss. Now for the story:&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Mark Farrell will finalize legislation at today’s Board of Supervisors meeting to mandate equal access for San Francisco tenants to all Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the area. Farrell’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfgov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;amp;ID=4834773&amp;amp;GUID=0DCCBCFF-6110-4276-B446-D4A990723825&quot;&gt;ordinance&lt;/a&gt;, an amendment to the Police Code banning favorable financial agreements between major providers and landlords, was approved by the Board’s Budget and Finance Committee last month, and will now receive its second reading before the full Board.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The ordinance will ban “exclusive access agreements” in which a property owner can arrange with an ISP to offer access to a single service, which the city hopes will enable tenants to choose their broadband connection as freely as property owners themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Critically, the bill's opening salvo reads: “No property owner shall interfere with the right of an occupant to obtain communications services from the communications services provider of the occupant's choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Fair market prices for internet access sounds like a no-brainer for such a tech-centric city as San Francisco, but the Supervisors are steeling themselves against much expected blowback. Today’s meeting will be preceded by a closed session with the City Attorney to discuss “anticipated litigation” in response to Farrell’s proposal, widely expected to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;These concerns are not without precedent. For example, Comcast has sued the cities of &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/04/comcast-brings-fiber-to-city-that-it-sued-7-years-ago-to-stop-fiber-rollout/&quot;&gt;Chattanooga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161026/07362935891/comcast-joins-att-files-lawsuit-against-nashville-to-slow-google-fiber.shtml&quot;&gt;Nashville&lt;/a&gt; in Tennessee to halt the construction of Google  Fiber infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We always like things that encourage competition in this market. This industry has suffered greatly due to monopolies,” said Anders Finn, Director of Technology at the local ISP &lt;a href=&quot;http://monkeybrains.net&quot;&gt;monkeybrains.net&lt;/a&gt;. “Now, I’ve seen some things in this bill that are going to force property owners to pay for upgrades, which I don’t think is completely fair. There’s a lot more market choice for the city’s more affluent residents, so in lower-income areas, we need to see more of a push for better internet.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Finn noted that Monkeybrains is working to install inexpensive broadband services in every unit at Hunters Point East/West, an apartment complex on Oakdale Avenue in the Bayview neighborhood, and that such projects would not be hindered by Farrell’s legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We’d like to see some of the onus to provide higher speeds and lower prices to be on the ISP, not entirely on property owners,” Finn continued. “Say you have a building from the 1920s with old wiring, and suddenly you find out you’re required to install Google Fiber and eat the cost. There are better ways to make that happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The ordinance’s latest amendments appear to have been adjusted to meet these concerns, at least for landlords in multi-unit buildings. Although a property owner is required by Farrell’s bill to notify the ISP if the building lacks the necessary utilities and infrastructure to accommodate upgrades, Section 5208 adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A property owner is entitled to just and reasonable compensation from a communications services provider that obtains access to a multiple occupancy building from a property owner…to provide communications services to occupants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Just and reasonable compensation” is defined as the “fair market value” of the impact work would have on a building.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though lawsuits may ultimately be unlikely from larger landlords, ISPs could conceivably find themselves sharing grievances with property owners who rent out a room in a single-family home, or may not otherwise qualify for just compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe that San Francisco, a city home to a large portion of the Internet, has residents suffering from a lack of quality broadband access— but its does. We live in a state with almost 200 different internet service providers, yet of the 40% of San Franciscans living in apartment buildings or condominiums, only &lt;a href=&quot;http://broadbandnow.com/California/San-Francisco&quot;&gt;3% have access to the fastest broadband technology available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many landlords and building owners get kickbacks in exchange for steering their tenants to big broadband providers or setting up exclusive contracts with those providers. Effectively, they get to cash in on limiting broadband choices while tenants pay the price. Fewer choices, and the resulting drop in service quality, mean that tenants are left to shell out more money for slower Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Here at the San Francisco Bay Area Renters’ Federation (SFBARF), we find that alarming. The status quo of limited broadband choice benefits landlords, property managers and ISPs, and hurts tenants.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Opponents of the bill claim it is unnecessary, tenants should shop for apartments with an eye towards leases that allow tenants free choice of broadband provider. “We don’t need laws telling us we have to allow any company into our buildings. We have concerns about safety, about the physical space,” said Ken Cleaveland, vice president of public policy for the Building Owners and Managers Association of San Francisco. “We think everything should be dictated by leases — you write what kind of services you provide into the lease.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Of course that is nonsense. Tenants in San Francisco are shopping for apartments with an eye toward affordability, and are in no position currently to be able to bargain with their potential landlords over choice of internet service providers.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Today, December 13th, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering an ordinance by Supervisor Mark Farrell that would make it easier for new ISPs to expand their services in residential buildings, helping spur competition in the broadband market to increase access and reduce prices.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfgov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2863893&amp;amp;GUID=E010FDC6-4024-4BA7-B282-C0F9DE32D9F4&amp;amp;Options=ID%7cText%7c&amp;amp;Search=&quot;&gt;“Choice of Communications Services Providers in Multiple Occupancy Buildings”&lt;/a&gt; ordinance would ban kickbacks from large ISPs to landlords and property owners, and would help promote the competition necessary for an equitable market and fair prices. The ordinance works for residents and for business—leveling barriers of entry for new ISPs and encouraging all providers to offer fair prices for faster, available internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It’s time for a change. Tell your Supervisor to vote “yes” on broadband choice by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.votervoice.net/Engine/campaigns/48219/respond&quot;&gt;signing the petition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Micah Danemayer, 28, channeled a life force that even death could not extinguish. Indeed, the Ghost Ship tragedy that claimed his terrestrial existence along with 35 others seems to only have brought me closer to the community Micah himself introduced me to, just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Micah was one of the first people to introduce themselves to me after I moved to the East Bay in 2014 and started attending local concerts. Between acts at the closing party for Downtown Oakland’s Moco Gallery, Micah simply passed me his bottle of bourbon and started talking to me about music, as though we’d known each other for decades. The feeling persisted, even after his passing, when he appeared to me in a dream this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Micah,” I said, “there are tributes to you all over town. So many good shows—I wish you could be there, man!”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Micah smiled and responded in his habitually cheeky way, sticking his tongue out and flashing the devil-horns hand gesture, shouting &lt;em&gt;slayyy it duder!&lt;/em&gt; I woke from my dream with the image of him smiling and winking, very much in the style of his idol, David Bowie.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At the Ghost Ship, Micah was manning the projector during various performances, conjuring masterful avant-garde splashes of light and color under the moniker Visual Aids, just as he had been last year, during my only visit to the ill-fated venue. I feel immensely fortunate to have experienced his multisensory art firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to overstate what a pillar Micah was in the local arts community. Last performing under the name &lt;a href=&quot;https://discardedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/paralycyst-damage-done-discarded-007&quot;&gt;Paralycyst&lt;/a&gt;, he combined a penchant for densely-textured industrial sounds with an unabashed love of pure, decadent acid techno. &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/redcellaroakland&quot;&gt;Red Cellar&lt;/a&gt;, his new duo with another local techno master &lt;a href=&quot;https://discardedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/regretamine-headcave-microrave-006&quot;&gt;Regretamine&lt;/a&gt;, was slated to make its live debut next month at Obscura Machina, Micah’s monthly series of curated “micro-rave” concerts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/1150785288339183/&quot;&gt;The show will go on&lt;/a&gt; in his honor.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Micah’s personal warmth and open heart brought him to introduce me to many other heroes in the Bay Area’s incendiary techno scene including &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/countervulture&quot;&gt;Countervulture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://discardedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/type-b-discarded-008&quot;&gt;Type B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://discardedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/forbidden-colors-discarded-004&quot;&gt;Forbidden Colors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/heartworm&quot;&gt;Heartworm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/hom&quot;&gt;HOM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/404-not-found-4&quot;&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://discardedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/bonus-beast-discarded-005&quot;&gt;Bonus Beast&lt;/a&gt;, to name but a few.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;In a landmark decision last Thursday, the San Francisco Planning Commission voted 5-1 to approve a project with 200 dwelling units at 333 12th Street in the South of Market (SoMa) District. Spearheaded by local developer Panoramic Interests, the project makes local history by being the first development in San Francisco to invoke the State Density Bonus law to add more units to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.panoramic.com/cityspaces-location/cityspaces-333-12th-st/&quot;&gt;“CitySpaces 333,”&lt;/a&gt; the eight-story building will contain 200 “micro-unit” apartments, some with up to four bedrooms, with bike storage and two car-sharing spots instead of private parking.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Initially planned solely for student housing, the project would have qualified under the city’s Student Housing Ordinance exempting the developer from including any on-site Below Market Rate (BMR) units. San Francisco recently raised those requirements to 25% BMR for new rental housing under June’s Proposition C, though CitySpaces 333 was grandfathered in under earlier, lower requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It’s a huge step forward,” said Zac Shore of Panoramic Interests. “The State Density Bonus dovetails nicely with our student housing application, enabling us to keep the subsidized units on-site while building 52 additional units of much needed student housing for nonprofit schools.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;CitySpaces 333 qualified for a 35% increase in density in exchange for providing 11% of its units—16 total—at rents permanently affordable to Very Low-Income households, defined as earning up to 50% of the Area Median Income. Should Panoramic end a leasing agreement with a 501(c)(3) educational nonprofit, the building would be required to provide an additional 7% BMR under the Western SoMa neighborhood plan.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In other words, this landmark project will combine student dormitories with subsidized housing for any low-income household that completes the lottery application process through the Mayor’s Office of Housing. Should the project cease to include dorms, more subsidized housing will take their place.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Shore also noted that the two additional floors would change the construction from a wood-frame building  to concrete. “The additional units granted under the state density bonus allow us to make that construction cost increase work financially, while keeping the subsidized units on site,” he said. “The state density bonus seems to be one of the only ways to work with the inclusionary housing requirements brought on by Prop C.” (Earlier this year, a &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/over-three-months-prop-c-has-reduced-production-of-affordable-housing/&quot;&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; found that fewer residential units had been proposed after the passage of Proposition C.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The state density bonus has been a hot-button issue in San Francisco politics: up throughout this year,  legislators and stakeholders were bitterly divided over the proposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoodline.com/2016/06/votes-on-dueling-plans-reveal-what-sf-supervisors-really-believe-about-housing-solutions&quot;&gt;Affordable Housing Bonus Program (AHBP)&lt;/a&gt;, a local implementation of the state density bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Planning Commissioner Dennis Richards voted in favor of the project, but also stated in an interview that he was open-minded to the opponents’ concerns that the density bonus did not adequately maximize affordability. “What we have is a policy issue, and you don’t evaluate policy over a specific project—you make policy to apply to many projects. So I think they got that backwards,” he said. “Now, what do you do to get the maximum number of affordable units you can? That’s what we have to figure out. That’s the policy issue.” Aside from their deliberations on specific projects, Commissioner Richards noted that the Planning Commission is able to send communications to the Board of Supervisors urging any number of policy reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The developer has the law on their side,” Richards added. “We sat there with the seven pages of the law printed out in front of us.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In late September, Governor Jerry Brown approved &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB2501&quot;&gt;AB 2501&lt;/a&gt; a bill proposed by State Assemblymember Richard Bloom (Santa Monica) requiring local municipalities to enact their own standards of compliance to the State Density Bonus. In part, the bill reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&quot;All cities, counties, or cities and counties shall adopt an ordinance that specifies how compliance with this section will be implemented. Failure to adopt an ordinance shall not relieve a city, county, or city and county from complying with this section.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;… &quot;A local government shall not condition the submission, review, or approval of an application pursuant to this chapter on the preparation of an additional report or study that is not otherwise required by state law, including this section.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;After a marathon hearing at the San Francisco Planning Commission, the 9-story apartment project proposed at 1296 Shotwell Street for low-income seniors in the Mission District received its permit approvals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The non-profit developers building the 94-unit project, the Mission Economic Development Agency (MEDA) and the Chinatown Community Development Center, have held community meetings for &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/05/neighbors-of-mission-district-affordable-housing-cry-too-tall/&quot;&gt;over six months&lt;/a&gt; to interface with concerned neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Units in the building will be reserved for senior citizens early 50% of the Area Median Income, with one-fifth further earmarked for formerly homeless seniors.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Craig Weber, an accountant and nearby landlord, objected to the total lack of parking and increased density on a residential street. Weber’s mother, Connie Weber, was the only other speaker testifying against the project. “We have enough big buildings,” she said, adding that she had lived on Shotwell Street for 85 years.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sam Moss, director of the Mission Housing Development Company, testified in response to fears that parking was a serious issue. “We know senior projects work well without parking,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Many local Mission District activists, noted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/12/senior-housing-on-shotwell-brings-foes-together/&quot;&gt;Mission Local&lt;/a&gt; as more frequently mobilizing to speak against market-rate developments, rallied to support the development. A variety of elderly Latino residents gave supporting testimony in Spanish, through an interpreter. San Francisco, one speaker insisted, “a beautiful city if it had buildings for all these people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Laura Clark, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.growsanfrancisco.org/&quot;&gt;Grow San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, was pleased with the outcome, but qualified her optimism: “If a perfect project like this, that everyone loves, with 100% affordable housing, still has to go through a five-hour hearing like this and face neighborhood opposition, what hope do we have of fixing the city’s raw housing shortage? I hope this sends a clear message that everyone stands to benefit from serious process reform.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;In 1979, California voters passed Proposition 13. This locked in property tax rates at a maximum rate of 1% of its assessed value, which can change at most 2% per year. Most voters (in the counties labeled green above) hoped to protect homeowners from the market volatility of their own equity values, preventing foreclosures that could occur if tax assessments became more than their incomes could bear. Sounds good, right?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the ballot measure legislated a de facto caste system benefiting legacy landowners. Ralph McLaughlin, Chief Economist at the real estate website Trulia has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/prop-13/&quot;&gt;recently published data to illustrate this&lt;/a&gt;: by comparing current assessments to market values, McLaughlin calculated “effective” property tax rates, essentially the difference between what an established owner pays, and what a new buyer would pay today.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Revolt” sounds too noble to me, even “populist.” I prefer to call it feudalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Prop 13 had further consequences: tax rates could only be reassessed upon sale of the property, whereas before, homes could be reassessed if anyone in the neighborhood sold for a higher price. Additionally, taxes in general became much more difficult to change. The state of California controls all property tax policy, and can only raise taxes with a 2/3 vote from the legislature. Municipalities could only introduce new taxes by referendum, also with a 2/3 margin if they intend to spend revenue for a specific purpose. Schools, infrastructure, and all sorts of public services have since relied on much less stable revenue streams, namely income and sales taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Like most policies enacted in response to fear, Prop 13 has demonstrably done more harm than good. The Legislative Analyst’s Office &lt;a href=&quot;http://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3497&quot;&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; what everyone has known for years: the tax burden has inordinately shifted to newer residents. Even within the same neighborhood, owners pay wildly diverging tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;More damningly, McLaughlin reports: “In 2015 alone, California homeowners received over $12.5 billion in savings from Prop 13, while local governments lost that same amount.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, since higher-earning households are more likely to own higher-value properties, the tax break inordinately benefits the wealthiest Californians. Palo Alto, one of the state’s most expensive towns, has the lowest effective rate. Mercifully, Palo Altans do not live in fear of underwater equity.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Lucky children who inherit valuable property also inherit their parent’s Prop 13-based tax assessments. Not only does the policy establish a sort of feudalism via subsidy, it also encourages the consolidation of dynastic wealth. New, young computer programmers with six-figure salaries may easy to scapegoat as the emblem of the Bay Area’s 21st Century inequality, but even if they can afford real estate, their privilege is chump change compared to that of pre-1979 homebuyers and their descendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, renters &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; renters do not get tax benefits for renting a place to sleep, only a place to work. While the state codified price controls for property owners, many renters were stripped of similar protections in 1995 when the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/its-time-to-overturn-the-state-ban-on-rent-control/Content?oid=4229744&quot;&gt;Costa Hawkins Act&lt;/a&gt; banned rent control in dwelling units built after 1977.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear: if your landlord raises your rent, and they’ve owned the building since before either tech boom, they are literally the landed gentry profiting off your serfdom. If that rent increase isn’t limited by rent control, you are being denied a privilege your landlord enjoys.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;You may assume that given this bleak picture, California lawmakers must be scrambling to make fundamental changes to the state’s tax structure, and you would not be wholly incorrect. State Senator Loni Hancock (SD09) has recently proposed a “split-roll” tax reform, which would gradually decouple Prop 13 caps on commercial real estate from those on residential property.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Split-roll reform has its own problems. Skeptics fear that only assessing commercial property at market rates would exacerbate imbalances between jobs and housing by further incentivizing commercial development over residential. But the logic in support is that it’s fairer to raise taxes on Disneyland than grandmothers living on Social Security checks. The cynical logic is that it’s the only politically palatable reform—but even current Governor Jerry Brown has said he won’t touch it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Before you close out of this article and curse Jerry’s obstinate, some would say overzealous pragmatism, let’s take a look at where the conversation on housing costs &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; gone. Like a feeble stream trickling through a rocky mountainside, the “third rail” of Prop 13 reform keeps the debate over housing reforms locked into tragicomic and ineffective limits.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco projects a culture that is, shall we say, not fond of capitalism, and the so-called “progressive” faction has seized on this image, while the ostensible “moderates” remain largely agnostic, or at least anemic. The progressive faction’s rhetorically compassionate, class-warrior-tinged proposals to solve the region’s crippling housing crisis tend to follow this basic narrative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is a shortage of housing supply. Yes, more must be built. But without strong protections for incumbent residents, and aggressive price controls to protect everyone without exorbitant incomes, all new privately financed market-rate development must be treated as guilty before proven innocent. New construction, lacking drastic state-wide rent control reform and ever-higher ratios of Below Market Rate units, will be guilty of gentrification and displacement. A shiny new mid-rise in the Mission District will not only fail to fully alleviate a supply shortage on its own, it will also raise median rents in the area such that vulnerable lower-income residents will be forced out. New development is bad until proven good. We need more housing, but let’s not be careless here.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Reasonable enough, no? No.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I’ll point to the more obvious holes first. Most demand for new construction has concentrated in the Mission District because San Francisco has lower-density zoning in wealthier neighborhoods once explicitly segregated for “whites-only.” When activists rally to protect the Mission, the elephant in the room is that nobody is wringing their hands about gentrification in North Beach, Pac Heights, Bernal Heights, Russian Hill, Forest Hill, and so on—because those neighborhoods &lt;em&gt;are already rich&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;they will be fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Marina Dwellers will be fine. Telegraph Hill Dwellers will be fine. Developers are not frothing at the mouth to build tall residences all over there for the influx of new workers coming to the city, except, notably, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/designs-released-for-affordable-housing-in-telegraph-hill/&quot;&gt;some low- and middle-income housing planned near the port&lt;/a&gt;. They should be.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In my paraphrase above, did you notice something missing? I used the term “Below Market Rate” (BMR) for what is often called “affordable housing,” but I did not use the term “subsidy.” This is because inclusionary zoning requirements do not provide price-indexed dwelling units with public money. Private development pays for it with a cut on investment returns—a cut that is passed on to market-rate renters.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;How curious, then, that the proposed “progressive” solutions to our housing affordability crisis contain many caveats that may end up being &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/over-three-months-prop-c-has-reduced-production-of-affordable-housing/&quot;&gt;a detriment&lt;/a&gt; to longer-term affordability goals. In the context of Proposition 13, this is relevant because inclusionary zoning (or fees paid “in-lieu” of “affordable” units) are a tax, but are much easier to codify, because they are not called a tax. Affordable housing is largely not funded by actual taxes because the vast majority of real estate equity gains are left untouched.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I’m going to shoot the messengers now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Prop-C-would-raise-new-housing-s-below-market-7388907.php&quot;&gt;coauthored&lt;/a&gt; the new 25% Below Market Rate requirements and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoodline.com/2015/04/major-8-washington-opponent-backs-peskin-s-d3-supervisor-bid&quot;&gt;opposed development on the city’s waterfront&lt;/a&gt;, was given a duplex in Telegraph Hill by his parents, purchased for $800,000, which was since converted to a single-family residence. Sale prices in that neighborhood often hit the $2 million mark now, but Peskin pays taxes on an assessed value of $1 million. Though also a realtor and landlord, Peskin magnanimously lacks a profit-seeking talent, at least in his role as a public official. During negotiations to sell city-owned real estate, Peskin demanded $7 million higher than the highest bid of $80 million, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/aaron-peskins-art-of-no-deal/&quot;&gt;the deal fell through&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Dean Preston, a tenant defense attorney, recently ran an unsuccessful campaign to replace London Breed as Supervisor for District 5. He has regularly called for restricting density along the transit-rich corridor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://hoodline.com/2015/10/affordable-divis-group-defines-goals&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1480730509962000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFPhv5XnzAFsiATQ0Bbfi3dxPfUbQ&quot;&gt;Divisadero Street&lt;/a&gt;, building less housing at the site of a former gas station, and has often &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/London-Breed-Dean-Preston-argue-personal-9283790.php&quot;&gt;condescended&lt;/a&gt; to Breed, a lifelong renter, during the campaign. Preston has admirably called for &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@DeanPreston/rent-control-for-midtown-2dfc435b971c#.db8z27fye&quot;&gt;expanded rent control&lt;/a&gt;, which is particularly admirable given the price controls he enjoys. About that: his home on Alamo Square, purchased by his wife’s parents, is assessed at just under $1.2 million. Homes around Alamo Square regularly fetch between $2-2.5 million sale prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Calvin Welch, who sits on the board of the Haight-Ashbury Neighborhood Council (HANC), recently described the Affordable Housing Bonus Program (AHBP), a density bonus allowing additional floors in new buildings in exchange for higher BMR percentages, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/01/sf-delays-controversial-housing-law-amidst-opposition-cries-of-ethnic-cleansing/&quot;&gt;“ethnic cleansing.”&lt;/a&gt; For &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/video-san-franciscos-pony-tailed-godfather-of-white-paternalism/&quot;&gt;a variety of reasons&lt;/a&gt;, he has been called the “godfather of white paternalism in San Francisco”—for example, after dismissing homeownership as a “bankrupt dream” in the early 1970s, he bought a duplex in the Haight. Its net taxable value hovers around $65,000 in a neighborhood with a median home price of $1.3 million (and that’s for single-family residences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Zelda Bronstein, an allegedly socialist firebrand, has written at length about &lt;a href=&quot;http://48hills.org/2016/11/28/17209/&quot;&gt;the indignation&lt;/a&gt; she feels about San Francisco’s projected population growth reaching 1 million people without anyone personally requesting her permission. She pays property taxes on an assessed value of $467,790 in a neighborhood where homes regularly fetch $1 million. Her most lauded accomplishment as chair of Berkeley’s Planning Commission is the approval of a park across the street from her house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Becky O’Malley, editor of the &lt;em&gt;Berkeley Daily Planet&lt;/em&gt;, is fond of writing screeds against new development and newer, younger residents in Berkeley. In one editorial, she &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2016-06-10/article/44573?headline=Keeping-on-Keepin-On-even-in-the-summertime--Becky-O-Malley&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; a planned 7-story apartment building near the UC Berkeley campus as “the kind designed for cramming in as many students who want to party it up without dorm rules as possible.” (The project will be replacing a 2-story commercial building that does not meet seismic safety requirements.) Mr. and Mrs. O’Malley, who founded the &lt;em&gt;Planet&lt;/em&gt; as a retirement project after selling a successful software company for millions, pay taxes on an assessed value of $116,440. Homes regularly surpass the $2 million price in their neighborhood, though the median is closer to $1.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Joe Bravo, a lawyer and landlord residing in Forest Hills, has publicly opposed a proposal for a five-story housing project for low-income senior citizens. In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.curbed.com/2016/11/18/13681294/forest-hill-sf-senior-housing-joe-bravo&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Curbed SF, Bravo said he objected to the height of the project, and feared that allowing development above zoned height limits would only benefit “high tech” people. Bravo’s home in Forest Hill is assessed at a $1.1 million net taxable value. Homes of a similar size sell for up to $3 million in that neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I made a handy graphic to illustrate this coalition’s approach to housing affordability:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;It is a given that the Bay Area does not have enough housing to accommodate population growth. Few deny this. It is also a given that land is finite in coastal cities, and new rental properties so prohibitively expensive, so privately-financed development alone will not ease this crisis for the state’s lesser-privileged residents (or, for that matter, lesser-privileged hopeful migrants).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;What is not as commonly agreed upon is who should pay more to bridge that gap between what the market will bear and what people need &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. Who is holding out on us?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A friend once told me, only halfway joking, that “if you want to eat the rich, it helps to have them living nearby.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Proposition 13, Old Money doesn’t want New Money living nearby. The rest of us are left to pick up the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;At a special meeting last night, Menlo Park’s City Council approved an upgrade to the city’s General Plan by a 4-1 vote, a significant reform to local land-use regulations that have been largely untouched since 1994. After weathering mild controversies over Facebook’s proposal to build workforce housing near their corporate campus, Menlo Park has essentially quintupled its allowable residential capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Known as ConnectMenlo, the plan to encourage mixed-use development in Menlo Park has been a top priority on the City Council’s Work Plan for 2016. These efforts include rezonings that will allow for more “vibrant” uses of land, including entertainment and retail where such establishments were previously not allowed. Crucially, the plan rezones the Bayside area, home to Facebook’s global headquarters, to include 5,500 dwelling units—a net increase of 4,500 units. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menlopark.org/DocumentCenter/View/12418&quot;&gt;staff report&lt;/a&gt; delivered to the Council, city staff “anticipates working with property owners to aggressively recruit new retail and entertainment uses as soon as the zoning allows.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The plan also includes goals for 20% Below Market Rate units in all new residential developments.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This update is the culmination of over 60 community meetings, in which neighbors and commercial stakeholders met to discuss a “live/work/play” neighborhood plan to revitalize a mostly industrial area. “Transportation was an important concern,” said Adina Levin, a Menlo Park resident and board member of Friends Of Caltrain who attended many meetings. “One of the motivations to approve the plan is that housing is an important transportation solution to help people commute and run errands without driving.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Under new Green and Sustainable Building Standards in the General Plan upgrade, future development will have to conform to requirements for water efficiency and recycling, including dual plumbing and water budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of an argument that arises time and again in San Francisco’s contentious land-use battles, the rezonings will also require a diversity of units, both for single occupants and families. One of the new districts will implement a “sliding scale” for the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of units, which staff writes “would help create a mix of appropriately sized units instead of a few units that are very large.”&lt;/p&gt;
