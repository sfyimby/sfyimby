				&lt;p&gt;Foster City managed to go from a landfill to a flourishing planned suburb in less than a century. Last night, the city’s Planning Commission debated how exactly that trajectory might continue on a parcel known as “Phase C” on Triton Drive. Developers at the Sares Regis Group hope to receive a rezoning for the area, largely allotted for office space, in order to provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/68-units-proposed-in-foster-city/&quot;&gt;68 townhomes&lt;/a&gt; with a shuttle service to the nearby Caltrain station.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The most vocal members of the Commission voiced concern that rezoning for more housing could slow the city’s commercial growth. The parcel is currently only zoned for 17 residential units. Commissioner and former mayor Richard Wykoff led the charge, arguing that there was “a conflict between downsizing the commercial space and the economic plan.” He strongly favored a compromise suggested by the Planning Department to build a hotel there instead, though no such project has been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While some local business owners did express concern over the loss of commercial space, the majority of local residents generally supported the additional townhomes. Commissioner Noemi Avram seemed more receptive to these views, noting that Foster City is the only locality on the Peninsula to require 20% Below Market Rate units on new construction. Foster City currently only has seven such units, so Phase C would effectively triple the amount of permanently affordable housing within city limits.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco housing advocate Laura Clark, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.growsanfrancisco.org/&quot;&gt;Grow SF&lt;/a&gt;, commented on what she perceived as a markedly tone-deaf atmosphere at the meeting. “The Commission, most prominently voiced by Wykoff, showed no concern for the fact that they are only 68% of the way toward meeting the minimum of their regional housing obligation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Last night's meeting was a study session, so no legislative action was taken.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Once intended to be Downtown San Francisco’s most appealing luxury condominium high-rise, the Millennium Tower has instead become a convenient symbol of the tragicomic hubris underlying the city’s real estate market. But whose hubris?—This has become the subject of heated debate, embroiling an ever-growing cast of characters in all sectors. According to those involved, who exactly bears the blame for the tower’s unstable property values and physical structure, sinking three inches at its base and sixteen inches on the top floor, is everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Aaron Peskin has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/supervisor-peskin-blames-faulty-millennium-tower-political-interference-plans-lead-investigation/&quot;&gt;called for an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the tower’s faulty foundation, suggesting that “political interference” may have rushed the building’s approval in 2009. Condo owners in the building launched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-millennium-tower-developer/&quot;&gt;class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging negligence on the part of developer Millennium Properties as well as the Transbay Joint Powers Association, which built its new terminal into the foundation of the tower. Both plaintiffs in the suit have blamed each other in decidedly undiplomatic press statements this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Transbay agency released a preemptive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtVteemLin4&quot;&gt;“I didn’t do it”&lt;/a&gt; statement &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.curbed.com/2016/9/14/12919764/millennium-tower-sinking-transbay-powers&quot;&gt;insisting&lt;/a&gt; that after Millennium Properties agreed to donate some of the tower’s space in exchange for “monitoring” its movement, they did exactly that. The TJPA argues that their repeated warnings before their terminal project broke ground went unheeded by the condo developer.  The agency not only shifted the blame for failing to warn owners back to the property managers, it also noted that they “anticipated” being blamed by Millennium Properties.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The agency additionally argued that they had offered an agreement to take on some of Millennium’s liability in exchange for joint record-keeping, which the developer declined. MP vociferously denied that this ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;MP was quick to fire back, insisting that the building had not sunk beyond “revised predicted ranges” until Transbay began building its adjacent foundation. (Though the developer insists their predicted ranges were safe, they did not specify what they were.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Most alarming among their denials of responsibility, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.curbed.com/2016/9/15/12930402/millennium-towner-sinking-foundation-buildings&quot;&gt;Curbed SF&lt;/a&gt; points out, is the Millennium Partners spokesperson’s comments about other buildings that, like their tower, did not drill their foundations into bedrock. The St. Regis Hotel, SFMOMA, the Embarcadero Center, and many prominent hotels also &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/98836506&quot;&gt;rest on the layer of sand&lt;/a&gt; known as the Colma Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Wherever the blame may ultimately fall, all parties involved can expect significant fallout from legal and legislative actions.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Last year had some nail-biter moments for the Mission Child Care Consortium. Facing an end of its lease in 2018, the city’s largest non-profit childcare agency &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/low-income-mission-child-care-center-worries-about-losing-lease/&quot;&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; a rent hike of nearly double what they were paying, from $28,000 to $50,000 per year, at its current site of 4750 Mission Street. Despite arguments to the contrary from the owner at the time, who insisted he had no intention of disenfranchising the non-profit, Mission Child Care successfully raised $5.6 million to purchase the building.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Consortium is situated between the Balboa Park and Excelsior neighborhoods, and is walking distance from the Balboa Park BART station. The 14 bus, with a stop one block north of the building, runs from Daly City all the way to Embarcadero Station.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ahsha Safaí, who is running to replace John Avalos as District 11 Supervisor, announced the transfer of 4750 Mission Street in a press release. “This victory is the result of 8 years of hard work and another 2 years of community organizing,” he writes, noting that the facility will continue to provide subsidized care for 224 children of working families.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Safaí, a resident of the Excelsior, supported an earlier attempt to purchase the property nine years ago, when he served as deputy director of the Mayor’s Office of Community Development. He also led a signature-gathering campaign in 2015 to raise support for a loan to finance the sale.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;This article is the result of our being unable to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vETxuL7Ij3Q&quot;&gt;“follow the money.”&lt;/a&gt; Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium, LLC has been a major donor in recent San Francisco elections, most notably the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/prop-c-approval-enables-legislators-set-affordable-housing-requirements/&quot;&gt;Yes On C&lt;/a&gt; committee. John Elberling, Director of affordable housing developer TODCO Group, LLC, founded both LLCs on the same day in 2013. TODCO &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.todco.org/our-housing/&quot;&gt;owns&lt;/a&gt; several senior housing projects, SROs, and Leland Apartments (pictured above), a multifamily apartment complex for disabled residents with Section 8 vouchers.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While TODCO receives income from government grants and property management, YBNC has no discernible source of income. Instead, it appears in a variety of campaign disclosure forms, effectively concealing the true source of donations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trauss.com/library/EthicsComplaintAgainstElberlingYBNC.pdf&quot;&gt;Ethics Complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed by Oakland resident and &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; co-owner Sonja Trauss alleges “egregious violations” of campaign finance laws. Trauss hopes the complaint will result in an audit which will reveal the source of YBNC’s revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Shell corporations are not a new trend in political campaigns. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/corporate-cash-john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin&quot;&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt;, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was investigated for taking potentially criminal donations from a third-party lobbying group funneling money from large corporate donors. Sources close to the &lt;em&gt;Metro Observer&lt;/em&gt; claim that Elberling adopted the same strategy for funding ballot measure campaigns, potentially from money he earned from refinancing TODCO’s low-income housing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Campaign literature for ballot measures is a common way for local political groups to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/electioneering.shtml&quot;&gt;“electioneer”&lt;/a&gt; for candidates as endorsers, increasing their name recognition while not counting toward the particular candidate’s legal spending limits. In forms filed by the “Affordable Housing for All, Yes on Proposition C” Committee, Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium donated a total of $125,000 between January and June of this year. After an initial contribution of $35,000, the Committee added “sponsored by Yerba Buena Consortium” to its name on their filings. Several endorsement mailers sent out on behalf of the Prop C campaign, included in the complaint, provided Supervisor Jane Kim with free publicity.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Although the Yerba Buena Consortium is incorporated as a Limited Liability Corporation, it lists its business practices on incorporation documents as “Nonprofit Community Advocates for San Francisco’s South of Market Neighborhood.” This is possibly an anachronism leftover from YNBC’s earlier incarnation as a tax-exempt 501(c)3 of the same name, which lost its tax-exempt status in 2011 after the IRS found they were negligent in their filings. By law, a registered 501(c)3 is not allowed to spend any money on political campaigns. The relationship between the LLC and 501(c)3 entities remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The East Bay suburb primarily known as the hometown of classic rockers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aae_RHRptRg&quot;&gt;Creedence Clearwater Revival&lt;/a&gt; may soon get a taste of multifamily urban housing. Oakland developer Holliday Development and the non-profit BRIDGE Housing have partnered in a plan for two apartment buildings near the El Cerrito Del Norte BART station adjoined by a pathway: a five-story 234-unit market-rate building, and a 4-story, 68-unit building of price-indexed Below Market Rentals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The site of the proposal, known as the Mayfair Block, is bounded by Kearney Street and San Pablo Avenue on the east and west, and Cutting Boulevard and Hill Street to the north and south. The parcel was formerly occupied by AK’s Food Corner. One building will feature 10,000 square feet of ground floor retail on the northern side facing Cutting Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In a special joint session of the Planning Commission and Design Review Board, the project received overall praise from city officials and the public, despite many proposed revisions. The &lt;em&gt;East Bay Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/09/12/el-cerrito-scrutinizes-del-norte-area-mixed-use-proposal/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that some community members described the separation of market-rate and affordable housing as “disappointing,” additionally lamenting the presence of “too much space for parking.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;BRIDGE Housing made note of a completed project built at the Pleasant Hill BART station in a partnership with Holliday. The non-profit agency is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bridgehousing.com/what-we-do/macarthur-station&quot;&gt;developing&lt;/a&gt; a mixed-use apartment complex next to the MacArthur BART station in Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The city of El Cerrito recently rezoned the area for higher-density development near transit under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.el-cerrito.org/index.aspx?nid=396&quot;&gt;San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan&lt;/a&gt;, adopted in December 2014. The Planning Department designed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form-based_code&quot;&gt;Form-Based Code&lt;/a&gt;, as well as pedestrian-friendly transit goals, “[i]n order to increase accessibility and livability while increasing land use intensity.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;An analysis conducted by the &lt;em&gt;Metropolitan Observer&lt;/em&gt; shows that since &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfgov.org/elections/sites/default/files/Documents/candidates/IHR%20Legal%20Text.pdf&quot;&gt;Proposition C&lt;/a&gt; passed June 6 2016, applications to build new housing have dropped by 58% overall, and applications to build Below Market Rate (BMR), subsidized housing have dropped 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We looked at the Preliminary Project Applications (PPAs) submitted to the SF Planning Department from June 2016 to September 2016 (post-Prop C passing) and compared those to the PPAs submitted during the same time last year, June 2015 and September 2015, to assess the effect of Prop C.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;There were 18 residential projects representing 3,000 housing units proposed between June 2015 and the first week of September 2015. Applying the then-12% BMR requirement to the total number of units proposed results in 350 below market rate units proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;../../news/over-three-months-prop-c-has-reduced-production-of-affordable-housing/propc2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;news_photo&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;12 residential projects representing 1,250 housing units were proposed during the same time period in 2016 - a drop of more than half from the prior year. The total number of affordable units these projects would contribute, is 289 affordable units - 61 fewer affordable units than what was produced in the same time period last year&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot; id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or a reduction of 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Proposition C was a ballot measure passed last June increasing the affordable housing requirement for new construction to 25% of total units. Some skeptics, including Mayor Ed Lee, argued that 25% was arbitrary. Opponents also feared that an excessively high BMR requirement would reduce the overall amount of housing proposed, and thereby reduce the amount of BMR units produced.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Proponents, led by Supervisors Jane Kim and Aaron Peskin, insisted that the measure was necessary to address the city's affordability crisis. The Supervisors further promised that they would be open to amending the requirement if analyses showed the requirement was in fact too high. Our analysis joins that of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/08/san-francisco-affordable-homes-requirement-prop-c.html&quot;&gt;City Controller's office&lt;/a&gt; in showing that the anticipated net production of affordable housing has decreased since this legislation went into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn-1&quot;&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Notably, while the affordable units anticipated from the July and August of 2016 proposals, post-Prop C, exceeds those same months in 2015, approximately 80% of the post-Prop C affordable units would come from just two large projects. That means if those two projects wind up not being approved, the vast majority of potential affordable units go away - down to about 50 total affordable units. So while, for a given project, Prop C might increase the number of affordable units, it still decreases the &lt;em&gt;overall number of large projects&lt;/em&gt; that produce affordable housing at all, concentrating the risk in just a small number of projects&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref-1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Last night, the Palo Alto City Council conducted a study session reviewing an upcoming proposal for 60 residential units to replace a vacant bus parking lot on El Camino Real, near the California Avenue Caltrain station. We sent our special Peninsula correspondent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markmollineaux.com/&quot;&gt;Mark Mollineaux&lt;/a&gt; to cover the meeting via Twitter, and have collected important highlights in a Storify feed below. (Readers curious enough to watch the meeting in its entirety can do so &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/5ZxwXIyYuIo?t=9m55s&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Local developer Windy Hill Property Ventures sought input from the council before making a formal proposal to submit to the Planning Department. The parcel at 2755 El Camino Real is currently zoned for Public Facilities, meaning that any development intended for anything other than city use must seek approval for a zoning variance. This project comes after a proposal by Hayes Group Architects for two stories of housing above ground-floor retail was rejected on the grounds that it did not provide enough housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Although complaints were largely procedural in nature, Vice Mayor Greg Scharff underscored the neighbor’s concerns that the project would add to traffic congestion. Under the current proposal, only 45 parking spaces would be provided for 60 units (all studios or one-bedroom apartments), which is below the 1:1 parking ratio required by local zoning. At one point, Scharff suggested to Windy Hill representatives that they may be asked to pay a fee in lieu of the additional parking spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mayor Patrick Burt, however, rebuffed many criticisms pertaining to car use,  encouraging council and the public to consider vast improvements in autonomous vehicle technology, Caltrain rail electrification, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Councilmember Cory Wolbach joined in urging the council to support the project, adding that he believed there was already too much parking proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood’s motto &lt;a href=&quot;http://midtownterrace.org/zoning.php&quot;&gt;reads&lt;/a&gt;: “Country living in the heart of San Francisco.” Though the median home price is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zillow.com/midtown-terrace-san-francisco-ca/home-values/&quot;&gt;$1.1 million&lt;/a&gt; in the suburban enclave just south of Twin Peaks, local historian Rex Bell &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Brief_History_of_Midtown_Terrace&quot;&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; it as “still a solidly middle-class neighborhood.” Whatever the subjective perceptions may be, organized neighbors are determined to ensure that city law enforces “country living” by amending the local zoning code.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Midtown Terrace homeowners have petitioned the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to amend the area’s zoning &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf-planning.org/sites/default/files/FileCenter/Documents/5358-Residential%20Standards%20Summary%20Table.pdf&quot;&gt;from RH-1 to RH-1 (D)&lt;/a&gt;. Though the differences initially seem subtle and benign, this zoning amendment could effectively render much of the existing built environment illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;RH-1(D) zoning prohibits any more than a single dwelling unit per lot, regardless of size. Under current zoning, a 4,500 square foot lot in Midtown Terrace could have at most two units (in other words, a duplex); several lots greater than 7,000 square feet in size allow a triplex.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of District 7, the supervisorial district that encompasses Midtown Terrace, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://localwiki.org/sf/RH-1%28D%29_Zones&quot;&gt;already zoned&lt;/a&gt; RH1(D). If the petition is approved, the new zoning would prohibit anything denser than a single-family home, anywhere in Midtown Terrace. This is particularly significant because there would no longer be density exemptions for Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), colloquially known as “backyard cottages”—other single-family neighborhoods in the Twin Peaks and Telegraph Hill Districts retain this exemption. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redfin.com/CA/San-Francisco/91-Aquavista-Way-94131/home/1637155&quot;&gt;Currently unpermitted ADUs&lt;/a&gt; in Midtown Terrace would effectively be illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Aside from density restrictions, RH-1(D) zoning also adds restrictions to single-family residences that can be built in the neighborhood. Rather than building to the edge of the property line, as the current zoning allows, new construction would be required to include side yards. It would also apply a minimum lot size of 4,000 square feet, although this would not retroactively apply to the majority of houses in Midtown Terrace, where the zoning currently allows a minimum lot size of 2,500 square feet.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The “D” in RH-1(D) stands for “detached dwellings,” since it bans townhome-style houses with no side yard separation. The Board of Supervisors’ Land Use and Transportation Commission will be considering the residents’ petition on Monday, September 19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2016/09/09/ford-partnering-with-global-cities-on-new-transportation--chario.html&quot;&gt;press release today&lt;/a&gt;, Ford announced that it would be partnering with a number of global cities on new transportation initiatives, starting with our own San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The automaker giant - an unlikely advocate for transit - will be sponsoring the Bay Area’s bike share program, expanding the fleet from its current volume of 700 up to 7,000 by the end of 2018. San Francisco’s share of this increase will be 4,500, up from its current, fledgling 328. And in another transit-friendly move, Ford has acquired Chariot, a San Francisco private commuter shuttle service (and lone survivor among Leap and other similarly positioned services), with plans to expand those point-to-point services as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ford is working with Motivate, a leading global bike share company, and city officials to add new stations and ramp up the volume of city bikes over the next two years. The program’s footprint won’t be limited to San Francisco either - the plans will include East Bay, including Oakland, Berkeley, and Emerville, and San Jose. Ford will be rebranding the Bay Area Bike Share program as “Ford GoBike” -  which users will be able to access through its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fordpass.com/en_us/home.html&quot;&gt;FordPass&lt;/a&gt; platform, which it touts as a one-stop mobility shop for a variety of transportation needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While the image of riding around in a public bike splashed with corporate logos may not appeal to the average San Franciscan, the bike-share sponsorship is undoubtedly good news for the city as a whole, and the Bay Area at large. Ford’s support will infuse the program with capital that may not otherwise be available through city coffers, and increase the availability of city-share bikes, hopefully easing the number of single-rider car trips and congestion on buses. The expansion into East and South Bay shows similar promise.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates speaks in favor of the program in front of San Francisco City Hall (courtesy: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikeeastbay.org/campaigns/bike-share-all&quot;&gt;Bike East Bay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;To that point, city officials around  the Bay have broadly expressed enthusiasm for this partnership. Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates spoke at an announcement outside City Hall earlier today, and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SFBayBikeShare/status/774297091162058752&quot;&gt;quoted&lt;/a&gt; by Bay Area Bike Share as “extremely excited about the prospect of getting these incredible bicycles to East Bay...This is the future!” Emeryville Mayor Dianne Martinez showed similar support on her &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BikeEastBay/status/774303788177907712&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Further, the extension of Chariot, while lower on the green transit totem pole than bicycling, also represents positive change for San Franciscans, in widening the assortment of transportation options for commuters. For parts of the city that are underserved by MUNI, BART, and other city-run transit systems, its advocates argue, this type of dynamic shuttle service can ease commuter pain at a cost competitive with Uber and Lyft - though still higher-priced than public transit options. And from an environmental perspective, if commuters can carpool in larger “pools” than shared Lyft or Uber rides, this would reduce the emissions related to those trips.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The first new bike stations are expected to arrive in spring of next year, with further expansion coming online through 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the Planning Commission received permit applications for an affordable housing project at &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionhousing.org/1950-mission-st-affordable-housing-takes-next-steps/&quot;&gt;1950 Mission Street&lt;/a&gt;. The project is an ambitious proposal with 157 apartments, architecture and amenities being designed by a steady stream of community input. The partnership between two nonprofits, Mission Housing Development Corporation (MHDC) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bridgehousing.com/&quot;&gt;BRIDGE Housing&lt;/a&gt;, will reserve 20% of its units (31 apartments) for formerly homeless families, and rents will be price-indexed for households earning 45% to 60% of Area Median Income.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Planned amenities include a rooftop garden, a communal living room and kitchen, and a bike maintenance workshop for neighborhood youth. The site lies between 15th and 16th Streets on Mission, a short walk from the 16th St &amp;amp; Mission BART station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;1950 Mission Street will replace a newly operational “navigation center” for the city’s homeless center, a pilot project run by the mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development. This currently occupies the abandoned site of the former Phoenix Continuation High School, which was vacated and listed as surplus property by the school district in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cervantesdesignassociates.com/&quot;&gt;Cervantes Design Associates&lt;/a&gt; and the Latino advocacy group &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.podersf.org/&quot;&gt;PODER&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded a community engagement process to design the building and its amenities. MHDC Director Sam Moss described community-based planning as a “guiding principle” behind the project. Aside from organizing several workshops among local stakeholders, PODER and Cervantes have also convened a 1950 Mission Community Advisory Committee to foster the relationship between neighbors and the project sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;BRIDGE and MHDC plan on breaking ground in 2017. San Francisco’s local &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfgov2.org/ftp/uploadedfiles/elections/candidates/Nov2015/AffordableHousing_Text.pdf&quot;&gt;housing bond&lt;/a&gt; will finance the $80 million project, along with federal funds from low-income tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Last night, the city controller’s office of San Francisco reaffirmed earlier recommendations curbing the price-indexed affordability requirements of market-rate development passed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco,_California,_Affordable_Housing_Requirements_Charter_Amendment,_Proposition_C_(June_2016&quot;&gt;Proposition C&lt;/a&gt;) last year. During the monthly meeting with the office’s advisory committee, Controller Ben Rosenfield supported lowering the percentages of Below Market Rental units required in new private development to be set at 14-18% per year, with a 0.5% increase each year. Under these non-binding recommendations, condominium development would have a 17-20% requirement as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Proposition C was co-authored by Supervisors Aaron Peskin and Jane Kim, who both assured critics they would reevaluate the affordability requirements per the Controller’s recommendation. Rosenfield has argued that any requirement above 18% Below Market would stifle overall housing production. Roland Li at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/09/prop-c-affordable-housing-study-for-sf.html?ana=twt&quot;&gt;San Francisco Business Times&lt;/a&gt; attended the meeting and provides the full scoop.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;News readers around the globe know the American satirical site The Onion as a steady source of prescient, incisive commentary on our modern society. Their hyperbolic headlines often reflect our deepest fears or ugliest biases, but seldom do we see life outright imitating their art. Amid a global surge in urban real estate prices, the particularly crisis-level housing shortage in London has prompted just that.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/31/londons-elite-pushed-out-of-exclusive-postcodes-by-super-rich?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; reported on August 31st: “London’s elite pushed out of exclusive post-codes by super-rich.” Sound familiar? In 2008, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theonion.com/article/report-nations-gentrified-neighborhoods-threatened-2419&quot;&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt; ran the satirical headline: “Nation's Gentrified Neighborhoods Threatened By Aristocratization.” It’s real. It’s happening. This is not a drill.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the London School of Economics’ (LSE) International Inequalities Institute have found that a surge of hyper-wealthy buyers have prompted the formerly elite establishment of lawyers, doctors, and other white-collar professionals “to buy in areas they previously considered undesirable.” Similarly, The Onion's article described how “the enormous treasure-based wealth of the aristocracy makes it impossible for those living on modest trust funds to hold onto their co-ops and converted factory loft spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The similarities are uncanny. Dr. Luna Glucksberg—the totally real, non-parodic researcher at the LSE— warned of “ripple effects” from the displacement of high-income workers to areas further down the market in price, a gentrification wave that could harm affordability for all Londoners. “The study shows that the wealthy individuals and families that live in London’s most exclusive areas no longer feel able to compete at the top end of the capital’s property market,” she told The Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The aristocrats in the older, um, fictional article voiced a similar concern. The new landed gentry, writes The Onion, “deflected blame onto regification, a process by which they say they were priced out of their vast rural holdings by kings who wished to consolidate property and develop monumental palatial estates.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The process known as “reverse filtering” is very real, and is outlined in John Mangin’s seminal study “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/stanford-law-policy-review/print/2014/01/mangin_25_stan._l._poly_rev_91.pdf&quot;&gt;The New Exclusionary Zoning&lt;/a&gt;” (2014). “In areas with a capped supply and increasing demand,” Mangin writes, housing in effect ‘filters up’—housing formerly occupied by low-income people becomes housing for high-income people. If high-income people are unable to build new housing for themselves, they will buy existing housing and fix it up.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/201&quot;&gt;made note&lt;/a&gt; of several analyses showing that real wage and population growth was receding from high-opportunity coastal areas to lower-income inland regions. “In part,” the LAO writes, “we suspect, due to California's lack of new residential housing supply and resulting high costs in coastal areas, a large portion of California's population growth occurred in areas of the state with incomes below the statewide median since 1990.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Perhaps The Onion was not being prescient so much as merely observing longstanding trends. Again, it’s worth repeating: This. Is. Not. A. Drill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/09/07/realm-plan-calls-for-pedestrian-oriented-telegraph-avenue/&quot;&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; by Taecker Planning and Design present an ambitious &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Telegraph-Public-Realm-Plan-Final-Low-Res.pdf&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; for Berkeley’s bustling Telegraph Avenue corridor. Already the city’s densest area outside of the downtown, the main artery of the “Southside” neighborhood would be revamped to ease traffic congestion and create an environment more welcoming of pedestrians.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;After efforts to preserve a two-story structure from the 1970s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/06/20/berkeley-council-denies-landmark-status-for-the-village/&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to stave off a seven-story apartment project, the Telegraph Public Realm Plan seeks to further adjust to the influx of students to the area—an ever-growing source of sales tax revenue for the city—as well as regional population growth. Local businesses have recently been welcoming of increased density, though transit improvements have been slow to reach the corridor after Councilmember Jesse Arreguin delivered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaklandliving.wordpress.com/2010/05/12/joel-ramos-car-enthusiasts-kill-brt-in-berkeley/&quot;&gt;decisive&lt;/a&gt; “abstain” vote against an environmental study of the proposed Bus Rapid Transit program in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Although Arreguin &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebyd.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/EBYD-Questionnaire-Jesse-Arreguin.pdf&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; at the time that he “was concerned about the loss of local service and the impacts that could have on senior and disabled bus riders” and would have supported a “better plan” with “dedicated lanes during rush hour,” his abstention resulted in only Downtown and East Oakland breaking ground on dedicated BRT lanes and passenger loading islands.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At the time, Berkeley City Council effectively approved a “no-build” alternative resulting in very little change for bus transit on Telegraph Avenue. Six years later, there is still no sign of protected lanes, but the Public Realm Plan does offer what the designers call “Shared Streets,” accommodating motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Taecker describes the concept as “a plaza-like place with a single ground plane, storefront to storefront, without being interrupted by a curb.” These streets would periodically be closed off to cars for event such as street fairs, which already occur on two blocks of the corridor, between the Durant and Haste intersections.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The plan will also be expanding piloted “Scramble Intersections” beyond the current Bancroft intersection, where a pedestrian-only traffic light allowsthose on foot to cross the intersection diagonally.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Sidewalks between the intersections of Bancroft and Dwight Way would be enhanced by public art, modular trash and recycling bins, and retrofitted street lighting. The corner of Durant Avenue, with wider sidewalks than adjacent streets, would host a plaza with public art and a parklet dedicated to exhibiting the rich history of Telegraph Avenue. The “Dwight Triangle,” in turn, would provide a southern gateway with another pedestrian-friendly plaza.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Demonstration projects are planned to be completed by 2017 at the latest. Depending on public reception, the plan could take anywhere from three to ten years, according to local news site Berkeleyside.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Last week, a Superior Court judge struck down legislation from Supervisor David Campos intended to protect school employees from no-fault evictions during the school year. As an extension of tenant protections already available to families with school-age children, the Campos &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfgov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;amp;ID=4384428&amp;amp;GUID=995CE4CE-1094-4BFB-BC9C-1301F971D14A&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; passed the Board of Supervisors unanimously, but was felled by a lawsuit from the San Francisco Apartment Association and the Small Property Owners of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes amid a slew of bad news for anti-displacement measures in the city, after Supervisor London Breed met with federal officials &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/08/supervisor-to-meet-with-feds-over-citys-anti-displacement-plan/&quot;&gt;to defend&lt;/a&gt; her “neighborhood preference” ordinance. The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently suggested that Breed’s legislation, which would give locals in a particular district priority in lotteries for Below Market Rental units, could violate the 1968 Fair Housing Act.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Legal counsel for the litigating property owners’ groups called Campos’s eviction protection for teachers “short-sighted” and “counterproductive” in light of the city’s raw housing shortage. Judge Ronald Quidachay agreed with this argument, calling it “invalid,” “preempted by state law,” and “unenforceable.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Campos, in turn, opined that the court was enforcing statutes that were out of touch with local needs. “We take a long view,” he told the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Judge-tosses-SF-law-preventing-teacher-evictions-9198849.php&quot;&gt;Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;. “You have a set of laws and systems that are not designed to deal with the housing crisis we are facing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.sfchronicle.com/2016/teacher-pay/&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the same paper found that median rents in San Francisco could take up to 64% of a standard teacher’s salary, more than double what the federal government recommends.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Perhaps no single real estate deal has been more emblematic of the Bay Area tech boom’s highs and lows than Uber’s purchase of the historic Sears building in Oakland. The ridesharing giant purchased the vacant building, now known as Uptown Station, from Lane Partners, a developer that had purchased it in 2014 for $24 million with ambitious redevelopment plans. Uber &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2015/09/uber-oakland-lane-partners-walton-street-capital.html&quot;&gt;paid&lt;/a&gt; $123.5 million for the property, which they plan to use for expanded headquarters—approximately half the square footage price of office space in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Uber &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buildzoom.com/property-info/1955-broadway-oakland-ca&quot;&gt;filed&lt;/a&gt; a permit application last week for interior remodeling, primarily for “structural upgrades at first floor atrium” and repairing stairs on the third and fifth floors. Observers expect many more filings to come as the company looks to convert the former department store into a modern tech office.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though initially expected to open in the spring, Uber says it now expects the new offices to open in late 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The office’s expected influx of tech employees has already shaped the narrative of real estate in Oakland’s Uptown District, which has already seen a resurgence of retail, restaurants, and music venues in the past decades. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redoakrealty.com/east-bay-real-estate-mls/OAKLAND-property-for-sale-3881-Martin-Luther-King-Jr-Way-OAKLAND-CA-94609?mlsid=40718150&quot;&gt;listing&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby Longfellow neighborhood two miles away advertises an empty lot as a “Developer’s dream come true,” urging bidders to “[p]ick this one up before others get the word that Uber is coming to town.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Last night, the Los Gatos Town Council voted 3-2 to deny a permit application to construct 320 residential units and 66,800 square feet of retail space, known as North 40. The decision had been deferred from an earlier council meeting to this special session.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Despite objections by the developer, Grosvenor Homes, Mayor Barbara Spector spearheaded the motion to deny based on its failure to comply with &lt;a href=&quot;https://legistarweb-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/pdf/21407/Staff_Report_-_N40_FINAL.pdf&quot;&gt;particular features&lt;/a&gt; of the town’s Specific Plan for the area. Although it is compliant with local zoning, with the implementation of the State Density Bonus, locals objected primarily on the grounds that the North 40 project did not provide enough senior housing for the area’s aging population. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://legistarweb-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/pdf/23957/081616.pdf&quot;&gt;minutes&lt;/a&gt; from a previous meeting on the project, the mayor cited the Specific Plan’s mandate that “the development should address Los Gatos unmet needs,
identified as Generation Y and Baby Boomers.” 50 of the 320 units would be price-indexed units reserved for senior citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;There were also broader objections to changing the character of a municipality with a small-town feel that has nevertheless faced impacts of the regional economic boom, particularly in the form of freeway traffic. The aesthetic concerns, combined with objections based on the Specific Plan, coalesced around the local citizens’ group Town Not City.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Councilmember Steven Leonardis expressed concerns over traffic near the hospital, which he said already faced significant congestion. “If we’re going to add more capacity…I’m wondering how that would be addressed, if there would be any monetary contributions, or add a right of way with a third lane going northbound,” Leonardis remarked.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Confusion abounded over the state’s HCD memo emphasizing that denial of the project could only be based on “objective standards.” Leonardis asked city staff, “does that mean we can’t recommend changes and improvements?” Under the interpretation of state law, staff said, architectural improvements would not be considered a breach of state law if they were incorporated into a subsequent proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Councilmember Marcia Jensen objected to what she considered excessive perfectionism in mandating specific details of an otherwise zoning-compliant project. Her final comment before the vote questioned the assumption that the Town Council “can cause a property owner to come to us with exactly what we want, in exactly the way we want it, at exactly the time we want…We cannot mandate exactly what the application is,” she concluded. Jensen urged the council whether this could negatively impact the overall production of housing in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sonja Trauss, founder of the San Francisco Bay Area Renters' Federation and co-founder of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlaef.org/&quot;&gt;California Renters Legal Advocacy and Education Fund&lt;/a&gt; (CaRLA), provided a brief statement. &quot;Los Gatos is out of compliance with the state's Housing Accountability Act, and we will be suing them to enforce the law and ensure that this project gets built.&quot; Trauss is currently spearheading an ongoing lawsuit in Lafayette on similar grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Pilar Lorenzana-Campo, Policy Director of &lt;a href=&quot;http://siliconvalleyathome.org/&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley At Home&lt;/a&gt;, was watching the live video stream last night. The Santa Clara County-based advocacy group has been speaking in favor of the North 40 project since it was first proposed. “We’re really disappointed with last night’s decision in the face of the housing crisis we have right now,” she said in a phone interview. “We really need every community to step up and make sure they build enough housing, including market-rate and affordable housing, to meet the needs of their workers. There’s not enough housing to go around, so their decision to deny this application after years of engagement is really disappointing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Lorenzana-Campo also echoed Councilmember Jensen’s sentiments that the denial represented undue perfectionism in the face of a severe shortage. “This is the project that has been before them for a few years ago. The fact is that they entertained the proposal and were working with the developers, with the project design in question—they needed to take action to improve housing conditions in Los Gatos. In denying the project, they are just making the housing crisis worse, not only for their residents and workers, and for other residents in their region. Now some other community is going to have to provide the extra housing to make up for the unmet need. This is a regional issue, and Los Gatos needs to shoulder their fair share, as do all the other cities in Santa Clara County.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Two San Jose tenants face an increasingly Sisyphean struggle to hold off a crushing rent increase that could force them to move. Through an arcane loophole in the city’s rent control law, landlords were allowed to raise rents beyond the legal cap in order to pass through interest rates of new mortgage loans onto tenants.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Although San Jose &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbamo.com/news/san-jose-eliminates-mortgage-interest-loophole-in-rent-control/&quot;&gt;amended&lt;/a&gt; the law to close this loophole in June, in the three-month period before it took effect, the city saw fifteen Debt Pass-Through Petitions filed, as many as had been filed in the last five years. City Councilmember Raul Peralez confirmed this statistic in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/JesseGaryKTVU2/videos/1572902493016105/&quot;&gt;interview with KTVU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Despite receiving an unfavorable ruling from a hearing officer, residents Keith Jones and Julie Allen of 85 East Taylor Street plan to appeal their case. Under the current court decision, rent on the studio apartment the couple shares will increase from slightly over $1000 per month to $1595. The couple has lived at their current residence for six years.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While San Francisco’s displacement epidemic has garnered national media attention, San Jose’s equally disastrous housing crisis has received little beyond lip service outside of the South Bay. The city recently found itself legally unable to halt the single &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2016/06/29/mass-eviction-san-joses-largest-to-displace-670-people/&quot;&gt;largest eviction&lt;/a&gt; in the Bay Area, with a developer slated to tear down 216 units of low-income units for three times as many market-rate apartments.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though the legal process will be costly, Jones and Allen do not consider the hike in rent to be any less of a burden. “To be honest, we could potentially pay this,” Allen said over the phone. “But we would be rent-burdened. It would be another $600 a month that could go to our savings, especially if we decided we wanted to purchase something.” She also noted that Jones, at 57, is approaching conventional retirement age. “We have to think about our future and our retirement. We like to travel, we like to enjoy life. And in emergencies, if someone has to go to the hospital or something, it would really cut into it. It’s a huge increase in the cost of living now, coupled with the fact that salaries aren’t rising to keep up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Allen also stressed that it would be “virtually impossible” to find something within a similar price range in the area. “We would be looking into moving out of the area, even out of the state.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Jones was frustrated that everyone from city officials to pro-bono legal aid from the Law Foundation encouraged him to negotiate with the landlord, a paradigm he says places undue pressure on vulnerable tenants. “More than likely, I will probably do [the appeal] on my own,” Jones added. “We can’t afford to pay the fees for a new attorney. If I bring the landlord into court, we may have to pay for the landlord’s attorney fees.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Historically, it’s very rare that tenants win in these kinds of cases,” Allen added. “We actually were able to explain our situation at the last hearing…but the whole thing that we initially heard about was landlord hardship. They never talked about tenant hardship.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Despite the cost burden, Jones pointed to significant technical oversights he was confident could help him win in an appeal. His main frustrations stems from the fact that the court’s hearing officer initially sided with Jones, only to abruptly change her mind. In the court’s opinion, the debt pass-through was not based on the mortgage itself, but an amortization of the clerical fees from applying for the mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“In the decision,” Jones explained, “she sided with the new landlord, though the ordinance clearly states that you need 60+ months in mortgage payments. The landlord only made 59. The decision  isn’t supported by what her argument is. 59 versus 60 payments is very clear.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Jones also disputed that the landlord had adequately documented the terms of their recent loan. “That the fees were amortized over 15 years—there is no documentation, no support as to whether the loan that the new landlord took out is amortized over 15 years. The only thing that is supporting that is a letter from the bank stating that the loan is amortized for 15 years. On all other documents, it says it’s amortized for 5 years plus a balloon payment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Because Jones and Allen both work full-time, Councilmember Raul Peralez was only able to schedule a meeting with them at the end of this month, after numerous attempts to meet with them in early afternoon hours.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;On December 8, 2015, Supervisor Aaron Peskin’s first day back on the board, Peskin celebrated by reneging a deal made by the city's &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfgov.org/realestate/&quot;&gt;Real Estate Division&lt;/a&gt; to sell 30 Van Ness for $80 million, potentially creating a $60 million liability for the city.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The city-owned site at 30 Van Ness Avenue will go back on the market on September 6th with no listing price. Roland Li at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/09/30-van-ness-san-francisco-housing-development.html?ana=twt&quot;&gt;Business Times&lt;/a&gt; reported the San Francisco Real Estate Division’s announcement earlier today, which has been widely anticipated since Supervisor Aaron Peskin &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfyimby.com/news/2016/8/2/aaron-peskins-art-of-no-deal&quot;&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; a proposed sale ten months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;30 Van Ness is currently a 6-story city office building. With an impending $60 million in seismic upgrades required to continue its office use, along with the revenue potential from its current zoning for 40 stories, the city decided put the parcel on the market. After vetting 15 offers from large developers, the  Office of Real Estate reached an agreement with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.relatedcalifornia.com/&quot;&gt;Related California&lt;/a&gt; to sell the property for $80 million and for the property to set aside 20% for affordable housing. Related proposed to build 40 stories with 500 dwelling units (400 rented at market rate, 100 Below Market Rentals) with one single entrance (no &quot;poor door&quot;) on prime transit-accessible land,. Related also planned to lease at least 5000 square feet of the space for a new child care center.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Despite having completed a competitive bidding process, several supervisors claimed to believe there was still another developer with a potentially better offer.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Peskin, bolstered by factional “progressive” allies Campos, Mar, and Kim, raised doubts that the $80 million offer from Related California was the highest return the city could obtain. The deal included an allotment for 25% Below Market Rental units if the proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco,_California,_Affordable_Housing_Requirements_Charter_Amendment,_Proposition_C_(June_2016&quot;&gt;Proposition C&lt;/a&gt;) requirements passed (which they did), with city funds paying the difference to increase the price-indexed unit ratio to 33%.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;During a marathon 9-hour meeting on December 8, 2015, Supervisors Mar and Kim both made statements to the effect that there was a “better deal to be had.” Supervisor Campos, representing the Mission District in Bernal Heights, chimed in: “Is this really, not even the best deal, but is this a good deal for the city and our district? I don’t know if I could say that…I think this is one of those things that in a very short time, we're going to look back and say, 'What the heck were we thinking?'&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I say this as somebody who has spent most of his adult life in the business of real property sale and acquisition that we, respectfully, are leaving a bit too much money on the table,” Peskin declared.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Our fundamental job,” the Supervisor continued, “is to get as much for our shareholders, the people of the city and county of San Francisco, as we can. And with all due respect to our department of real estate, we have not gotten that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A city official testifying at the meeting informed the Board that all other bids were significantly lower than the $80 million Related was offering. After the sale was voted down, no higher offer came before the city.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;John Updike, director of the city’s real estate department, expects that the city will make a decision among future bids by the end of the year. The developer would have to pay for seismic upgrades, and would have the option to maintain its current use as office space.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Jane Kim buoyed a relatively positive atmosphere in a town hall meeting on housing policy, easily San Francisco’s most severe and contentious political issue this year. Joined on a panel by former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and BART Board candidate Lateefah Simon, Kim’s forum, hosted by Salon magazine co-founder David Talbot, highlighted the city’s crisis-level wave of displacement along with the Supervisor’s policy objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Before the forum began, Villaraigosa told Tim Redmond of &lt;a href=&quot;http://48hills.org/2016/08/31/kim-packs-housing-forum-former-la-mayor-hints-gov-run/&quot;&gt;48 Hills&lt;/a&gt; that he would “make an announcement in November” regarding his potential run for Governor. Villaraigosa is widely expected to run for the office against former San Francisco mayor and current Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of Scott Wiener picketing outside Mission High School&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Outside Mission High School, with an auditorium capacity of over 1,000, supporters of Supervisor Scott Wiener, Kim’s rival candidate for State Senate, picketed before the event began. Protesters held signs, many in Chinese, criticizing what they saw as empty promises from Supervisor Kim in spite of an inconsistent record on housing. Signs such as “Housing Not Tents” in particular referred to Kim’s opposition to a sales tax to fund homeless services, which she considered a regressive tax, as well as her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/tempers-flare-homeless-tent-encampment-ballot-measure/&quot;&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; requiring seven-days’ notice and temporary shelter before clearing tent encampments.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kim remained optimistic about her policy goals, in particular touting her efforts at increasing inclusionary requirements in new market-rate developments. Without requiring price-indexed units in new buildings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/08/supervisors-forum-considers-housing-and-transportation/&quot;&gt;she argued&lt;/a&gt;, market-rate condos in the city were only affordable to families making at least $270,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Supervisor boasts in her campaign promotions that she successfully negotiated higher percentages of affordable housing from developers, namely a 40% Below Market Rate set-aside in the controversial 5M project.  This qualification has recently come under criticism for basing the percentage off a smaller denominator than the total amount of units. Rather than a full 40%, Joe Eskenazi of &lt;a href=&quot;http://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/how-supervisor-kims-new-affordability-law-lets-developers-the-hook&quot;&gt;San Francisco Magazine&lt;/a&gt; reported that the number would be closer to 35%.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kim’s flagship 2015 ballot measure Proposition C has also seen recent criticism for requiring 25% of units be price-indexed for low- and middle-income households, a ratio Mayor Ed Lee called “arbitrary” at the time it was proposed. San Francisco’s City Controller released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/08/san-francisco-affordable-homes-requirement-prop-c.html&quot;&gt;draft report&lt;/a&gt; last month suggesting that a requirement above 18% had the potential to slow down overall housing production. Kim and Prop C co-author Supervisor Aaron Peskin had promised to recalculate the requirements pending the Controller’s final analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Kim’s newest ballot measure proposal, Proposition X, has also been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/07/sf-made-san-francisco-ballot-pdr-jane-kim.html&quot;&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; as “arbitrary” in its requirements. If passed by voters, the measure would require the developers to preserve 50-100% of “PDR” space (production, distribution, and repair) in industrial zones. SF Made, a union of 650 manufacturers in the city, publicly opposed the measure. They argue the measure would needlessly slow housing production by forcing new projects to be leased for lower-revenue uses, and have advocated for housing industrial tenants in larger spaces instead. Kim made a brief mention of Proposition X at the forum, stating that it was an important strategy to preserve blue-collar jobs in San Francsico.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Housing itself was just a starting point for panelist Lateefah Simon’s broader vision for socioeconomic equity. Simon, a native of the city’s Fillmore District, now lives in Oakland due to the cost of rent. A lower-income worker forced to move to Richmond, she noted, would pay upwards of $300 per month in BART fares to and from their job in the city. Transportation and housing, in her view, were inextricably linked in her progressive policy goals for social justice.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Villaraigosa, several years out of the political limelight, stumbled on a few recent issues when describing his experiences trying to grow the affordable housing stock in Los Angeles. “There was a real problem of people saying, ‘we don't want those people in our neighborhood,’” he remarked. He proceeded to outline hypothetical policies that happened to coincide with the Governor Brown recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/08/unions-against-gov-browns-as-of-right-housing-plan.html&quot;&gt;“by-right”&lt;/a&gt; proposal—a policy he later admitted he had been unfamiliar with until that night. Kim had voted in favor of Supervisor Aaron Peskin’s resolution opposing the legislation, which Mayor Lee quickly vetoed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It was a rally masquerading as a forum,” said Laura Clark, founder of housing advocacy group Grow SF. “The host just lobbed softballs at her the whole time. I can’t complain though; it was a really good rally.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Fort Winfield Scott is home to long-abandoned concrete structures with an austere past, once occupied by 17 gun batteries and a central headquarters for Harbor Defenses San Francisco (HDSF). After World War II, the Presidio site housed the Army’s Coast Artillery School after it moved from Fort Monroe, Virginia in 1946. The air force and hydrogen bombs soon rendered the coast artillery network obsolete, and the school closed in 1950. Fort Scott officially closed as a military outpost in 1956.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;125 years after the first batteries were built, and in anticipation of the centennial anniversary of the National Park Service, local art group the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.for-site.org/&quot;&gt;FOR-SITE Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has developed ambitious &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.for-site.org/&quot;&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; for repurposing the site. The group is most widely known for their recent Ai Weiwei exhibition on Alcatraz Island. Their project, entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.ctctcdn.com/fc32f3de501/902e1519-9841-4c8d-bd36-fcb92899bad4.pdf&quot;&gt;Home Land Security&lt;/a&gt;, will bring 16 artists from around the world to present installations in the vacant batteries, each exploring the bellicose themes that the site evokes.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;As the legislative session came to an end this past Monday, one important housing law that made it past the Senate was &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/ShippingContainerCottage.jpg&quot;&gt;SB 1069&lt;/a&gt;, a bill that would ease local requirements on “granny” or Accessory Dwelling Units.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Presently, local governments can impose a number of restrictions on granny-units, including requirements related to parking, setbacks, and installation of utility connections, hurdles that often prove too costly or onerous for primary unit owners to implement. By prohibiting these restrictions, the law has the potential to ease the state’s housing crunch by opening up many existing units for renting out. This is considered a relatively unobstructive change to current state land use policy that will allow cities, particularly urban centers, to accommodate more residents.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Several cities, in fact, have already loosened secondary unit requirements, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland. In 2015, the Board of Supervisors approved &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-oks-new-housing-units/&quot;&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; to legalize in-law units in Districts 3 and 8 of San Francisco, covering North Beach, Chinatown, and the Castro and Noe Valley, respectively, under proposals introduced by supervisors Scott Wiener and then-supervisor Julie Christensen. In January of this year, Oakland passed an ordinance eliminating the additional parking space requirement for any secondary units located within a half-mile of a BART station or other major transit stops.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Even with many cities taking initiative with respect to increasing secondary unit availability, a broader-sweeping, state law offers much more punch toward the cause. The bill includes encouraging language toward the end of increased housing availability, declaring accessory dwelling units an “essential component of housing supply” in California. That state lawmakers recognize and are enacting measures to ease the housing crunch is a promising sign for California, and an indication that local housing challenges can be at least partially resolved at the state level.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Governor Jerry Brown has endorsed the bill and is expected to sign it into law. 
State Assembly, Jerry Brown, Accessory Dwelling Units&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;We started this news site with the wholly altruistic (pinkie promise) intentions of spreading far and wide our cheeky obsession with videos of local government hearings. It's easy for us to forget in the Bay Area that this top-notch prime-time viewing happens all over the country, even the rest of the non-American world.

				&lt;p&gt;Last year, the saga of Berkeley’s controversial &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/01/14/lawsuit-filed-to-stop-building-of-harold-way-complex/&quot;&gt;2211 Harold Way&lt;/a&gt; project appeared to have ended with a cliffhanger. City Council voted to uphold approval of the 302-unit building, which plans to replace Shattuck Cinemas with a new theater and contribute $10.5 million into the city’s Housing Trust Fund. Development consultant and former Planning Commissioner Mark Rhoades noted that this money could be leveraged to construct 100 permanently Below Market Rental (BMR) units. Neighborhood opponents vowed a reprisal, and two subsequent lawsuits alleging improper Environmental Impact Reports delayed groundbreaking indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In addition to 177 underground parking spots, community benefits cited include 10,000 square feet of commercial space and a 10-screen movie theater replacing Shattuck Cinemas. The project will also provide $1 million into an arts fund, with $250,000 going to assist the Habitot children’s museum in its relocation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits filed independently by Kelly Hammargren and James Hendry under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) were merged into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/08/29/court-considers-challenge-to-berkeleys-2211-harold-way-project/&quot;&gt;joint hearing&lt;/a&gt; at the Alameda County Superior Court. Local news source Berkeleyside provided full coverage of the lengthy hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;For four hours on Friday, Hammargren and Hendry presented their arguments over the project’s environmental impacts, frequently digressing into political remarks against developers. Judge Frank Roesch had to instruct the audience not to cheer and applaud Hammargren’s speeches. “We don’t think that political speeches are very helpful in solving the puzzle,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of Hammargren and Hendry's lawsuit, notorious for opposing any new development in Berkeley, dubbed &quot;the fabulous fighting forty&quot; by local housing advocates (source: Berkeleyside)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Hammargren and Hendry displayed a conspicuous lack of legal experience in their self-representation. At one point, Judge Roesch denied Hammargren’s motion to introduce a map of the building’s western environs, which she claimed would show adverse health impacts due to the construction site’s proximity to Berkeley High School. The court only allowed evidence that had been included in the administrative record, which included 15,000 pages of documentation and video from 37 public hearings.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Attorneys from Manatt Phelps &amp;amp; Phillips represented developers HSR Berkeley Investments and Rhoades Development Group. Zach Cowan, City Attorney of Berkeley, also presented arguments. Hendry cited his experience attending administrative legal hearings as a motivation to represent himself.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When reached by phone for comment, developer and planner Mark Rhoades bitterly decried what he saw as a vindictive, anti-democratic process. “As a Berkeley resident, an urban planner, and a housing provider, this saddens me. This is exactly why Berkeley—and the state of California in general—has the housing crisis that we do. People have choices to make. They can continue to fight when they are in the voting minority and hold up the rest of the democratic process, or they can choose to respect the democratic process.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When asked what he meant, he elaborated: “What’s being done here has no respect for the democratic process; it’s a demand for their own way. They’re holding a project hostage …The units are held up, the Housing Trust Fund money is held up, a state of the art movie theater is held up, money for Habitot is held up. It’s all held up by two residents because they’re aggrieved, first by Berkeley’s vote on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/10/20/18024/&quot;&gt;2010 Measure R&lt;/a&gt;, and also how the city implemented that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Rhoades also noted that the initial impact fee requirement was only $6.2 million. The city asked for, and the applicant agreed, to provide an additional $4 million in additional community benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At the end of the hearing, Judge Roesch announced that he would deliver his ruling on the CEQA suit within 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Readers may recall the Housing Accountability Act, a little-known state law that made headlines last year in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/City-activists-brazen-new-battle-cry-Sue-the-6485289.php&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Lafayette. The California Renters Legal Advocacy and Education Fund (CaRLA) decided to sue the East Bay suburb after it goaded a developer into downsizing a housing project from a 300-unit apartment complex into 44 single-family homes. In its current form, the law gives standing to applicants and potential tenants to sue a municipality for rejecting a zoning-compliant housing project for less-than-“objective” standards.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The California State Legislature passed an amendment on Tuesday that could expand the power of this law. Under new language introduced by Assemblymember Tom Daly, organizations representing tenants and housing projects could also sue to enforce the law. The State Senate passed the bill unanimously, and it will next go to the Assembly before reaching the Governor’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Housing groups around the state have praised the amendment as a boon to their advocacy efforts. In a letter supporting the bill, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://caanet.org/tool-enforcing-pro-housing-law-advances-governor/&quot;&gt;California Apartment Association&lt;/a&gt; noted that “[o]ne of the most significant barriers to the construction of new affordable housing is unjustified local resistance from NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) groups.” They went on to describe the amendment as applying “appropriate pressure” to municipalities hesitant to more housing in the midst of a statewide shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ryan Patterson, legal counsel for CaRLA in the Lafayette suit, was cautiously optimistic. When reached by email, he offered the following comment: “Previously, nonprofit housing organizations lacked standing to file lawsuits on their own behalf. Although its scope is modest, this law gives advocacy organizations a new tool to support housing development proposals.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Three cigarettes light up an otherwise dim, intentionally-dingy room. Over the next few hours, they will burn out and be replaced. It occurs to me that the popular idiom has become reality—I am literally in a smoke-filled room, observing local politics unfold. “I should warn you,” one of the hosts says, “my views are distinctly non-progressive. I’m going to be trying to poke holes in all your views.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;His guest laughs. “All I can say is, bring it. I'm ready.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mike Lee lives on the streets of Berkeley. You can catch him at the downtown Starbucks, or at Au Coquelet, and sometimes at the YMCA.  He’s happy to talk about his mayoral campaign to anyone who will listen. Passers-by can spot his campaign posters, advertising “A New Vision For A New Future” all over downtown. Sporting a Whitmanian grey beard which somehow amplifies his steady baritone pipes, he looks—by early 20th Century Marxist standards, anyway—like much more of a statesman than his cleanshaven opponents: Councilmembers Laurie Capitelli, Jesse Arreguin, Kriss Worthington, in his view the “only serious candidates” besides &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oldbumformayor.org/&quot;&gt;himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;By the gracious invitation of the disc jockeys, I came to an undisclosed location to observe his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mixcloud.com/christopher-lexx-stanley/mike-lee-dr-vee-wlexxx-1041fm-sf-live-in-studio-8-19-2016/&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; on a local pirate radio station. DJ Christopher “Lexxx” Stanley, a personal friend I also run into all over Berkeley, declined to mention me save as a “member of the audience,” but by the end, my inquisitiveness got the best of me, and I was allowed to ask questions over the air.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A defaced ad for Mike Lee in Downtown Berkeley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Political debate began in earnest well before the interview. While DJ Lexxx played anything from disco hits to punk rock obscurities, his co-host “Dr. V” grilled Lee, though he called it “prepping.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Though he only moved back to Berkeley &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/06/29/would-a-homeless-mayor-in-berkeley-make-a-difference-for-the-homeless/&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; (from Las Vegas), Lee has a storied history in Berkeley. In 1991, he was one of the four protesters sued by UC Berkeley for disrupting the University’s attempt to pave over People’s Park. Along with Bob Sparks, Carol Denney, and David Nadel, Lee was named as a “key leader” in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caroldenney.com/slapp.pdf&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; UC police had failed to shut down by violent reprisal. (People’s Park, now a historic landmark, is a legendary flashpoint for protests ever since the city demolished low-income housing on the site via eminent domain in 1967. The resulting protests, in a sense, created the park.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Lee still boasts that he regularly disobeys a court injunction preventing him from setting foot in People’s Park, “because I don’t recognize [the university’s] authority.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It is fascinating to see him and Dr. V spar casually, like veteran boxers who don’t care if anyone wins. Lee is quick to call him a “libertarian,” and it is clear that the two share anti-authoritarian sentiments from opposite sides of the political spectrum. Dr. V attempts to guide Lee into a discussion of economic rent, and asks whether Lee considers local land-use policies as an example of it. “’Rent’ is wealth extraction by political means—restrictions on an otherwise free market,” he clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I think those who would want a free market realized it wouldn’t work in our society,” Lee answers.  “So they set up a political process to make sure they benefited from it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I worked on prisoner stuff during that time—[Leonard] Peltier, Mumia [Abdul-Jamal],” he says when the conversation drifts back to People’s Park. His episode with the park seems to inform most of his policy positions, revolving around his insistence that local government bodies, including the Planning Commission, be “community based.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It’s bullshit that the [Zoning Adjustments Board] has so much authority. I think zoning is bullshit anyway because it’s not community based.” What then, I ask, would his answer be? His answer is one I press him to clarify throughout the subsequent interview: any developer wishing to build in Berkeley, under a Lee administration, would need 80% approval (“not popular vote,” he clarifies: “approval rating, by polls”) from the council District before being built. Districts, furthermore, would be subdivided into “neighborhood councils” of a 10-by-10 block area.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;More surprising was his suggestion that community opinion could sway his own policy positions: “Despite my reservations about the minimum wage increase, it’s clearly what the community wanted, and I respect that.” Later in the interview, he would describe his interactions with local small businesses that would not be able to absorb the cost. Strangely, his position on the popular soda tax is not swayed by the electorate, and he dismissed the measure as “the stupidest idea.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;He was quick to dismiss &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bengould.org/&quot;&gt;Ben Gould&lt;/a&gt;, a UC Berkeley graduate student also running, as “an apprentice to developers” for views he has dubbed “market urbanism.” I asked him about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laurieforberkeleymayor.com/&quot;&gt;Laurie Capitelli&lt;/a&gt;, a retired realtor and current Councilmember whom many consider the top contender for mayor. Here he adopted a more conciliatory tone.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to agree to disagree on a lot of things, but we want to improve the quality of life for everyone. That’s attitude that I’ve carried for years,” he said. “[City Council], they wish I would go away. But they find me a reasonable and rational individual. [City] staff takes notice.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;I asked him how, despite his disagreements, he was able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/08/12/op-ed-its-not-rocket-science-to-solve-homelessness/&quot;&gt;collaborate&lt;/a&gt; with Capitelli on piloting a Tiny Homes project, with labor donated by the local carpenters’ union. “He knows my attitude to him—I openly call him Crookitelli. He laughs and says, ‘oh shit, it’s Mike Lee!’ We have mutual repsect for each other’s positions. When we first met, I said to him, ‘Understand that whatever I say on this campaign, it’s not personal. This is business, this is politics.’ That’s how we got Tiny Houses.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The interview did not cover much related to land-use. Lee’s campaign promises had more to do with the police: “My first day in office, I will announce, racial profiling in Berkeley ends today.’” He cited the December 7, 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Berkeley as an instance of undue violence against peaceful protesters, which BPD openly boasted of in their meetings with the Police Review Commission. His top priority, he said, would be to strengthen the authority of an independent Police Review Commission.  “They killed Bob [Sparks], but they can’t get rid of me,” he said in another allusion to the 1991 suit. He went on to detail grisly episodes of profiling by Berkeley police, both against communities of color and the poor in general.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Lee did not hold back on his scorn for every other mayoral candidate, including Capitelli’s lead opponent, Jesse Arreguin. “You walk around Downtown Berkeley and it looks like a third-world country. It’s dusty, it’s dirty…obviously, as a professional politician, he hasn’t done very well. We have New York-sized city rats running around. And when we look at the type of development that’s going on downtown, he’s not protecting the interests of his constituency in District 4.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;(Curiously, Arreguin voted against the controversial &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/12/09/berkeley-approves-construction-of-harold-way-high-rise/&quot;&gt;2211 Harold Way project&lt;/a&gt;, citing among many objections that the $10 million the project would be contributing to the city’s Housing Trust Fund was not enough. However, the council voted unanimously to approve a $13 million tax rebate for a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/05/27/new-334-room-downtown-berkeley-hotel-gets-the-go-ahead/&quot;&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt; above the downtown Bank of America, which Lee was also quick to criticize.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Of his “buddy” Capitelli, he simply said that it was “inappropriate” for a realtor to be making any land-use decisions on the city council. “If he wins, we all better buy tents, because we won’t be able to afford 4, 5, 6 thousand dollar rents.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Lee also dismissed contender Kriss Worthington’s statement that “Berkeley does not need to move to the right on any issue” as “a lot of flim-flam.” Why? “We need to move to the right to fiscal responsibility…because of the fact that we are $1 billion underfunded on just two areas: labor, and infrastructure. We need a half a billion dollars just to fix the infrastructure…Based on that statement, I don’t want [Worthington] sitting in the mayor’s chair.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;One of Lee’s more unique policy positions is providing Council representation for UC Berkeley students. Comparing their lack of representation to the Boston Tea Party, he insisted that such a vital part of Berkeley’s sales tax revenue needed its own legislative representation. Currently, students can only vote if they are residents within the city of Berkeley, though many remain registered at their parents’ place of residence.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;As an advocate for his fellow homeless residents, Lee held Arreguin’s recently championed Homeless Task Force in vast contempt. Berkeley’s current homeless policy, in his view, consisted of “criminalization, or a baloney sandwich and a pat on the head.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The worst thing I find about City Council is that they have right now on their desk two proposals that would reduce homelessness by 20% at no cost to the city. They ignore it because they can’t get any political capital out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;He found the report of the Homeless Task Force to be particularly offensive because it overlooked basic issues of sustenance and breaking the cycle of poverty. “In the report, they included Maslow’s triangle. At the bottom, food and shelter; at the top, yoga and meditation.” (The &lt;a href=&quot;http://cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Council_4/2015-06-23%20WS%20Item%2001%20Homeless%20Task.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; posted on Arreguin’s website has no mention of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&quot;&gt;Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs&lt;/a&gt;, but does include recommendations to increase public restrooms in the downtown area, funded in part by imposing a vacancy tax.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Lee also praised the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yeah-berkeley.org/&quot;&gt;YEAH&lt;/a&gt; youth shelter in Berkeley. In his view, it was the only homeless service in town that had complete accountability, and “Jackie [Grant, Executive Director] can get you the numbers in thirty seconds.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Lee has butted heads with a different Jackie, who I initially had conflated: Jacquelyn McCormick, former mayoral candidate and now Arreguin's campaign manager. McCormick excoriated Lee in the past over a sit-in Lee organized to protest Council’s inaction on police and homeless issues. “I hope you realize that anything that lasts more than one day or overnight will be used against Jesse,” McCormick wrote in an email, which Lee then posted in its entirety on the Capitelli campaign’s Facebook page. “This will play right into Capitelli’s hand.” Lee replied with his characteristic candor: “That’s a load of crap and you know it. Me publicizing this email will do more damage. If Jesse loses it’s because someone else won, not because a homeless man protested.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mike Lee is no stranger to controversy on Facebook. An anonymous source sent us screenshots of Lee implying a call to assassinate current Berkeley mayor Tom Bates, which Lee dismissed as an intentionally inflammatory joke.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Lee (Facebook alias Sam Spade) posts incendiary comments about Mayor Tom Bates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The candidate is firm that he is the only candidate who walks the districts and talks to the community. He pointed in particular to the hypocrisy of claiming lowered vacancies in Downtown Berkeley, while many storefronts remain vacant on Solano Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Community is a very nice word,” Dr. V added. “But if somebody acts in the name of the community, it’s a very flexible word that all sorts of specific interests can take control of—you get back to the Platonic question of who will guard the guardians?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Dr. V went on to describe Berkeley as a “class-based” and “Tory” community that wants “strict zoning…and a jacked up minimum wage to feel good about themselves.” This was where I jumped in.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Lee’s housing platform is ambitious and uncompromising. In addition to his 80% approval standard, he would impose a requirement of either 50% of new dwelling units be “affordable” (price-indexed to local incomes), or that 50% of profits be donated to the city. “If people say that will make it so nobody wants to build in Berkeley, fine by me,” he added. I think we have enough luxury housing anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;If Lee proposed total local autonomy, I asked, how could he guarantee that North Berkeley wouldn’t become an even more exclusionary community than it already is?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;For context, I live within walking distance of the North Berkeley BART station, which is surrounded by an entire block of surface parking. I have yet to see any new multifamily housing development being built north of University Avenue. Why should North Berkeley neighborhoods have the same autonomy that South Berkeley craves to ward off new market-rate construction? In the strongly-held opinion I expressed, the restricted density of North Berkeley’s zoning unduly shifts the burden of surging regional demand onto much poorer parts of Berkeley, which largely remained poor enclaves thanks to historic redlining and blatant racism. This is a unique point of agreement I have found with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/08/05/friends-of-adeline-our-future-shall-be-determined-by-us/&quot;&gt;Friends Of Adeline&lt;/a&gt;, a neighborhood group with close ties to Lee.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The candidate remained firm that his solution would maximize fairness. “We are organized to defend our community…” He insisted that this would in no way let North Berkeley “off the hook” in demand for new construction. Dr. V, in turn, took the hardline libertarian stance that abolishing zoning could undermine regulatory capture by wealthy neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“If somebody wanted to develop,” Lee said, “the only place where they can do that, especially if you’re talking about 21 stories… is North Berkeley.” I was blown away by his answer, and said so, but Lee wasn’t done yet. He went on to describe Solano Avenue business owners who told him they were only in business thanks to foot traffic from the CVS. “Mr. Capitelli, I’m coming after you,” he said without any hint of humor. “Why is it that we aren’t taxing these vacant storefronts? Why aren’t these high-rise buildings coming up [on Solano]? Instead of building so much on Shattuck and down on Adeline, why don’t we build it in your neighborhood?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;I left the undisclosed location with a bit of a cough after inhaling so much tobacco smoke. Nevertheless, part of me was glad to have escaped the puritan milieu of Berkeley to somewhere people could smoke indoors. In parting, Lee offered a firm handshake and his eagerness to stay in touch throughout the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At press time, the Tiny Homes project with Capitelli remains on hold until after the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The debate over Berkeley’s historic downtown post office has reached new heights. The United States Postal Service filed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trauss.com/pdfs/berkpostofficesuit.pdf&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in federal court yesterday alleging that Berkeley’s zoning changes in the neighborhood prevented them from selling their property to generate much-needed revenue. (As of 3:00 PM today, the Berkeley City Attorney’s office says they have not been formally served.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the Postal Service put its property at 2000 Allston Way up for sale, noting that it only used 4,000 square feet of the 57,000 square foot building. Amid possibilities of new development, Berkeley locals launched a vociferous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savethebpo.com/&quot;&gt;Save the Post Office&lt;/a&gt; campaign to block the sale of the property. This campaign gathered signatures for what eventually became the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/City_of_Berkeley_Zoning_Ordinance_Amendments,_Measure_R_(November_2014&quot;&gt;2014 Measure R&lt;/a&gt;), a ballot measure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenbelt.org/blog/examiner-com-measure-r-bad-policy-berkeley/&quot;&gt;lower height limits&lt;/a&gt; in Downtown Berkeley, drafted largely by Councilmember Jesse Arreguin and Zoning Board Member Sophie Hahn.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The heated tensions of downtown development ignited over what initially appeared to be an innocuous transaction. The Postal Service has been hamstrung by federal regulations requiring the agency to prepay its pension plans, while also being prevented from raising its prices to compensate. In response, the USPS has put dozens of historic real estate assets on the market. The recent “historic” overlay in the zoning of Berkeley’s Civic Center District effectively prevented its sale for most viable commercial or residential purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Initially, that didn’t stop the Postal Service from trying: in 2014, local developer Hudson McDonald offered to buy the property and keep it publicly accessible, but then retreated due to “uncertainty” in the surrounding community.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The City of Berkeley then sued the federal agency to force them to drop any attempted sale. Although the suit was thrown out of court, Berkeley succeeded in its goal, only to engender threats of litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The United States Postal Service was not bluffing. In their suit, the plaintiff alleges: “Enacted primarily to prevent the sale of the Berkeley Main Post Office, the Zoning Ordinance limits the Property to civic or nonprofit uses. By prohibiting any commercially viable uses, the…Zoning Ordinance therefore prevents the Postal Service from fulfilling its responsibilities under federal law, and is invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution...”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The suit goes on to detail the many ways in which, despite engagement with the local community, the Postal Service’s efforts at compromise were stonewalled by the City. Offers to preserve the historic façade of the building were rejected as insufficient by what the plaintiff depicts as byzantine bureaucratic standards.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;At press time, no hearing date has been set for the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The project at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Development-with-25-percent-affordable-housing-9157776.php&quot;&gt;1515 South Van Ness&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above) struck a deal with the city to provide 25% Below Market Rate units. Some supporters called it unprecedented, while others insist it should be the new citywide standard. Under &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco,_California,_Affordable_Housing_Requirements_Charter_Amendment,_Proposition_C_(June_2016&quot;&gt;Proposition C&lt;/a&gt;), that may now be the case, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Affordable-rent-demand-could-slow-construction-in-9178589.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&quot;&gt;new evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that may not be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisors Jane Kim and Aaron Peskin were adamant last year that their ballot measure set an economically sound baseline for affordable housing requirements in the nation’s most expensive city. Requiring 25% of units to be indexed Below Market Rate in any new project was not an arbitrary standard, they claimed, but one assiduously negotiated between the Supervisors and developers to maximize subsidies without slowing housing construction. According to city comptroller Ben Rosenfield, their math is off.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Mayor Ed Lee withdrew his opposition to the “arbitrary” requirement of Prop C on the condition that Kim and Peskin would adjust the requirements after a feasibility analysis. Rosenfield’s recently published draft feasibility analysis recommends a lower threshold, but one that should be applied equally across the city. While this urging is likely to incense local activists who insist on higher percentages in higher-demand areas such as the Mission, Rosenfield also recommends increasing required in-lieu fees to incentivize the construction of more units.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“New apartment buildings can rent a maximum of 18 percent affordable units before new housing is likely to be impeded,” the draft report concludes. Neither Peskin nor Kim’s offices could be reached for immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A 7-story apartment &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastbayredeveloped.com/2016/08/oakland-1750-webster-7-story-mixed-user.html&quot;&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; may soon break ground at the intersection of 19th &amp;amp; Harrison in Oakland, mere blocks from the 19th Street BART Station. Developers at Lennar have proposed 224 residential units above 3,700 square feet of ground-floor retail at 1750 Webster, which would include 219 parking spaces despite its proximity to transit.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The new building would share a block with a proposed 24-story mixed-use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2015/05/oakland-housing-tower-gerding-edlen-perkins-will.html&quot;&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt; at 1700 Webster. At only 206 units, the “vertical neighborhood” designed by Perkins + Will, the architecture firm that renovated San Francisco’s Ferry Building, would be less dense than Lennar’s mid-rise project. As the Oakland market becomes more competitive and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/01/oakland-development-few-land-deals-housing.html&quot;&gt;difficult to finance&lt;/a&gt;, the 1700 Webster tower managed to secure full financing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Lennar is also currently developing a similar mid-rise project in Berkeley, known as Parker Place.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;In a San Francisco neighborhood plagued by electrical fires and a lack of sprinkler systems, two five-story phoenixes may soon rise from the ashes. A 16-unit building has been proposed for the now-vacant lot at 2630 Mission Street, 5 feet under the 65-foot height limit, but a full three stories above the surrounding buildings. The lot was left vacant (pictured above) when a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/arts/television/dick-assman-briefly-a-late-show-celebrity-dies-at-82.html&quot;&gt;5-alarm fire&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the Big House discount store in late 2014. Project sponsors Gabriel Ng + Architects have not specified if they will provide on-site Below Market Rental units or pay an impact fee, as required by the city.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The building at 2610 Mission Street may soon see significant renovations that would add 4 stories (with only 8 dwelling units) above ground-floor retail. The building had been home to Anna’s Linens, which recently filed for bankruptcy. The master tenant, which had been subletting to Anna’s Linens, recently accepted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socketsite.com/archives/2016/03/tenant-buyout-clears-the-way-to-raise-the-roof-on-mission.html&quot;&gt;buyout offer&lt;/a&gt; to truncate the remaining 30 years of a 99-year lease. At 8 units, the project falls below the 10-unit city threshold to require a fee or BMR units, and it also will not require approval by the Planning Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A long, sad trombone note echoes through our SF YIMBY office today as we mourn Governor Edmund G. “Jerry” Brown’s by-right housing bill, a legislative beacon of housing hope taken from us far too soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Imagery aside, this truly does mark a disappointing move by the State Assembly, and a backward step toward solving the state’s acute housing shortage. Jerry Brown’s proposal would have streamlined construction that complied with local zoning and planning requirements and included a portion of below-market-rate housing, removing additional layers of local review that add to lengthy timelines and ultimately, increase housing costs. Not only that, the bill included a $400 million appropriation for affordable housing, funding California has been starved for.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While approving a compliant, affordable housing-inclusive project should sound like a no-brainer, the bill was vehemently opposed by labor groups, environmentalists, and tenant activists, whose demands appear to have eventually taken down the proposal. Several weeks ago, environmentalists and unions walked away from negotiations with the governor’s office before a compromise could be reached, and it didn’t take much longer before the bill was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article96492302.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&quot;&gt;deemed “dead”&lt;/a&gt; for the year by Assembly leader Anthony Rendon.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;We applaud Jerry Brown for initiating this bill. Addressing the housing shortage at the state level is one of our best hopes at increasing our housing supply, as local land use restrictions have increasingly transferred decision-making power to wealthy, incumbent homeowners, at the expense of those in need of housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, a bill of this nature will rise from the ashes next year.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Architects at Leddy Maytum Stacy recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfport.com/88-broadway-seawall-lot-322-1&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; their plans for a 6-story building with 186 units of affordable housing at 88 Broadway Street, at the base of Telegraph Hill. Known as Seawall Lot 322-1, the project has been described by the Port of San Francisco as “the greatest affordable housing development opportunity among the Port’s seawall lots in the northeastern waterfront.” Nevertheless, the project has faced stiff opposition from incumbent neighborhood groups, including the Telegraph Hill Dwellers, over the specific parameters of affordability.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In the current plan, 11,400 square feet of ground-floor retail would replace what is currently a parking lot. Above it, BRIDGE Housing and the John Stewart Company will be partnering to build 150 residential units for households making 40-120% of the Area Median Income, with an additional 32 units reserved for senior citizens earning 40-70% AMI. The project would also include a mixed-income childcare center run by the YMCA of San Francisco. Lutheran Social Services will also provide on-site support for 37 apartments reserved by subsidies for formerly homeless households.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A coalition of local groups such as the Barbary Coast Neighborhood Association and the Telegraph Hill Dwellers successfully forced developers and the city to include units for households earning 80-120% of Area Median Income. Barbary Coast president Robert Harrer told the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/morning_call/2015/03/telegraph-hill-port-parking-lot-affordable-housing.html&quot;&gt;Business Times&lt;/a&gt;, “We don't want to be a neighborhood that ends up with just the rich and poor. We want a neighborhood that's for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The median home price in Telegraph Hill is listed as $1.1 million on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zillow.com/telegraph-hill-san-francisco-ca/home-values/&quot;&gt;Zillow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Outside of California, voters don’t elect their transit officials. That changed for San Francisco in 1972, and now BART District races can be as competitive as elections for State Assembly. Shortly before the filing deadline, Gwyneth Borden threw her hat in the ring for the BART Board of Directors election in District 9. Voters will now choose between local activist Michael Petrelis, former Supervisor Bevan Dufty, and Borden.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Borden currently serves as Director of the SFMTA, and is a Commissioner on the Parking Authority. She is also Executive Director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, a nonprofit representing regional restaurants, and formerly worked at IBM.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Borden has been a steadfast advocate for car-alternative infrastructure during her tenure with the SFMTA. Just this week, as opponents railed against the bus-only red lanes on Mission Street as “ethnic cleansing,” Borden fired back with a diplomatic resolve to diminish the perception of a “malicious intent” by the transit authority.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Primarily people of color are disproportionately impacted by the time it takes to get from where they live…to where there is more activity,” she said, insisting that SFMTA had designed the lanes as part of a broader MUNI Equity Study. “I take that bus every single day…I don’t have a car,” she noted. She described an experience of riding “packed” buses along Mission Street, filled mostly with senior citizens and people of color commuting to work.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Business is down this year and we don’t know why,” she added, noting that the city's port had also reported revenue losses that year, regardless of new bus lanes. “The intent was right,” she reiterated. “This is a start…This is not about trying to push people out. This is about trying to include and bring more people to where they need to go more quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Whatever one’s opinion on the bus lanes may be, it is beyond any doubt that Dufty and Petrelis now face stiff competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leigha Beckman is a Special Contributor to SF YIMBY.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles – that bastion of car-centric metro sprawl, has lately made surprising progress toward smart, urban growth in recent years. It has dramatically increased residential density downtown with some 22,000 new units under construction; its car ridership is trending downward, and LA Metro plans to raise $120 billion with a sales tax measure on projects like Bus Rapid Transit (“BRT”) corridors and light rail extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Things have been looking good for Los Angeles – until now.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;And before I go any further, I must say that admitting anything positive about LA as a San Franciscan is heresy, obviously; even worse if you are from the perennially blaspheming Orange County like me, and NorCal apostasy is your thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But for once, being from Orange County doesn’t make me the villain in this story. No, that award goes to the likes of shiny blue medalists Leonardo DiCaprio, Kirsten Dunst, and Joaquin Phoenix, amongst other Hollywood stars who are backing a conservative, regressive anti-growth measure called the “Neighborhood Integrity Initiative”. These celebrities, whose well-informed opinions about urban planning policy surely matter, decided to lend their “famous people I like support this” credence to the proposal’s merits.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The appealingly monikered “Neighborhood Integrity Initiative” is a proposed ballot measure that would severely inhibit development in LA by essentially banning any deviations from the existing General Plan (a restrictive and outdated framework responsible for heavy downzoning and the sprawling mess we see today), and worst of all place a two-year moratorium on any development project that requires an exemption from the area's height requirement (which would be most of them).&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;San Franciscans – sound familiar? Remember Prop I from last November?&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;If you know anything about local politics—in virtually any locality—you should know that something called the “Neighborhood Integrity Initiative” is pretty much guaranteed to lack integrity, and far more likely to favor paranoid incumbency and fear-mongering over common sense or forward thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let’s take a closer look at the 23-page measure itself, rather than skimming emotionally charged aphorisms from biased sources, because the text of the bill is what actually matters, not a slogan on Leo’s T-shirt. (Not that Leo wears t-shirts.) As with most ballot measures of this nature, it begins with a slew of dramatized findings that allegedly characterize our present, but follows those findings with backward looking solutions as the irrefutable fix.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In fairness, the initiative does capitalize on a truth of Los Angeles’s planning system, which is that existing design perimeters (height limits and zoning restrictions, in particular) can be maneuvered through various workarounds in the planning code. What it fails to do is address those shortcomings in a method beneficial to the overall urban planning landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;For example, this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Piecemeal amendment of the City’s General Plan violates principles of comprehensiveness and long-term general planning embedded in the City’s Charter…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;is a fair objection. Why have a General Plan if you’re going to bypass its requirements with each new project? But this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“The development of projects containing a significant component of multifamily housing has an adverse impact on health and safety when such projects are approved in areas that are not currently zoned for housing on such a scale or which do not currently permit housing on such a scale under the General Plan…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;is misleading and reactionary. The implication that apartment buildings should only go up where we zoned for them to decades ago – never mind any changes in planning needs, population growth, or new academic literature that may better inform our decision-making – flies in the face of the desperate housing needs of a growing number of young adults, newcomers, renters, and otherwise non-comfortably housed LA residents.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;80 to 85% of Los Angeles is zoned for single-family homes. While that sounds great it you already a single-family homeowner – an increasingly exclusive privilege – it severely limits the ability to find housing for everyone else. This zoning system leaves just 15-20% of LA’s zoned areas available for everything else, including multifamily residences.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;So rather than acknowledge that perhaps zoning laws need to be updated, the measure invokes a protectionist “get off my lawn” attitude toward newcomers, or even existing residents who are being choked by the region’s exorbitant housing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It is worth reiterating that car ridership is declining. The initiative would probably undo that, by calcifying parking space requirements for new developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“…under no circumstances may the required on-site parking be reduced by more than one-third (including by remote off-site parking) from the number of spaces otherwise required to be provided by any other applicable provisions of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This is especially ironic given that one of the measure’s chief concerns is that new residents strain existing roads and other infrastructure, so rather than looking for ways to promote bicycling and other less impactful forms of transit, they instead double-down on maintaining (or limiting the reduction of) existing parking requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;And finally, if you think you are being green by blocking new development in dense, urban areas, empirical evidence would like a word with you. We need population growth to take place in already-developed, preferably urban locations – otherwise we sprawl outward in energy-draining, polluting, increasingly unsustainable ways. Living in cities is far better for the environment than the low-density system of sprawl the NII folks seem to prefer: the average carbon footprint of households living in the center of large, population-dense urban cities is about 50 percent below average, while households in distant suburbs are up to twice the average.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This is a dismaying display of reactionary, old-guard NIMBYism, and just as dismaying that ostensibly left-leaning, well-meaning Hollywood names are behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Now is not the time for LA to lock in an outdated planning code. If the planning system is broken, let’s apply forward-looking fixes – not an unwanted sequel of the failed past.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;This morning, Supervisor London Breed called a press conference in the Western Addition neighborhood to engage the public in her resolve to protect her Neighborhood Preference &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/san-francisco-adopts-neighborhood-preference-for-affordable-housing-lottery/&quot;&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; in the face of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/san-francisco-adopts-neighborhood-preference-for-affordable-housing-lottery/&quot;&gt;federal pushback&lt;/a&gt;. Breed’s ordinance, passed last year, would reserve 40% of Below Market Rentals built in San Francisco for residents living within the same supervisorial district, or a half-mile away. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) said recently that they considered giving priority to local residents in a highly competitive lottery to be a potential violation of the Fair Housing Act.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by African-American community leaders, in the shadow of the Willie B. Kennedy Apartments with 98 units for seniors, Breed capitalized on the vagueness of HUD’s decree to underscore its hypocrisy. In her view, it was not segregation to give preference to local residents, but rather an effort to fight back against decades of segregation and economic isolation. She had strategically located the press conference across the street from the public housing where she had grown up, and walking distance from other housing projects that had also benefited from neighborhood preference.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;“Even Willie Mays was not allowed to live in Forest Hills,” noted the Rev. Amos Brown, president of the local NAACP Chapter. He described how the Western Addition had become a hub for the local African American community, which had lost 60,000 residents since 1970, because of restrictive covenants preventing them from living in other neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Malia Cohen, also in attendance, added that the ordinance was designed to help other disadvantaged communities in San Francisco, including Latinos and Pacific Islanders. “It is not exclusionary…it is reversing a pattern of exclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Breed noted that the Neighborhood Preference ordinance was already in effect at the nearby housing project at 55 Laguna Street. Additionally, she pointed to New York City’s longstanding policy of neighborhood preference as a successful strategy for stemming gentrification and displacement. She also described plans to work with the Mayor’s Office of Housing to “hit the streets and get the word out” to help as many local residents in need to fill out applications. Cathy Davis, Executive Director of Bayview Senior Services, said she would be leading volunteers 7 days a week in helping locals apply for housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Breed insisted that San Francisco’s shrinking black population had “no fair chance” to access new affordable housing units. She described a process in which a competitive advantage is gained by organizing thousands of applicants to flood the lottery. The neighborhood’s largely poor and black residents, she said, could not compete with these resources. “There are people here I see daily who are struggling to live here…who has time to complete an application when you’re struggling?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“San Francisco has been living a lie,” the Reverend Dr. Amos Brown declared. “This mayor and the Board have sought to tell the truth.” He criticized HUD’s judgment as an example of “left-brained bureaucracy…without compassion.” Further, the SF Chapter President promised that the NAACP would plan to file an injunction to stop further rentals until they could negotiate with HUD officials. He urged all those in attendance to join his efforts and “stop this hemorrhaging and loss of the black community in San Francisco.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Breed was far more diplomatic in announcing her plan, saying that she planned to meet with Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Nancy Pelosi. She had also already given Julian Castro, current Secretary of HUD, a walking tour of the Western Addition.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;It was also noted that the Western Addition had lost 30,000 residents during the period of Redevelopment in the 1970s, when many public housing projects were torn down and never replaced. In later remarks, Breed made mention of the “Pink Palace” apartments that had once been at the same location—an apartment where Dianne Feinstein, as mayor in the 70s, had managed to prioritize senior housing with neighborhood preference.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisors Breed and Cohen were later joined by local activist Rico Hamilton. As a resident of the Western Addition, he described the local community as being “in disbelief” at HUD’s opinion, given the area’s history of racial segregation and concentrated poverty. He also noted that he was “technically homeless” as he was not leasing his current place of residence.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When asked about the comparison to New York City’s longstanding policy, Breed said that she did not know why HUD had decided to impugn her legislation, less than a year old. “They did not said they know, or think—they believe it might be in violation of the Fair Housing Act.” HUD’s indictment of her policy appeared to be a mere hunch, in her interpretation. “We can’t live on a hunch,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amos Brown then stepped in to described what he believed to be a local conspiracy to undermine Breed’s legislation. “I have it on good authority that there are people in this city who are opposed to the ordinance, who have HUD’s ear,” he said. “The enemy is in the camp.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When reached by phone, Dr. Brown was unable to elaborate on his sources or any further details. But he did add further lurid allegations: “All I can tell you is there was organized opposition to [Breed’s ordinance]. The regional HUD office knew about the adversary group stacking applications against [locals]. They also told developers that they didn’t have to advertise in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbayview.com/&quot;&gt;Bay View&lt;/a&gt;, and other black newspapers…They [regional HUD office] knew this was going on, and then tell us that we can’t pursue a measure that would help to ensure this hemorrhaging stops.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Late last year, Board of Supervisors President London Breed touted the passage of a neighborhood preference ordinance intended to protect vulnerable residents of color from displacement. Under the ordinance, 40 percent of all new Below Market Rentals would be reserved for income-certified people already living in the supervisorial district in which a new project was being built, or within a half-mile of the project. The federal government just declared that ordinance &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trauss.com/pdfs/WBK_neighborhood_preference.pdf&quot;&gt;illegal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Gustavo Velasquez, the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity , penned a letter to the mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development, which said that Breed’s plan could “limit equal access to housing and perpetuate segregation” in violation of the 1968 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Housing_Act&quot;&gt;Fair Housing Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The ordinance was intended to give the city’s poorer incumbent residents, particularly African Americans, a local advantage in affordable housing lotteries. Supporters noted that although San Francisco’s population has sharply declined, from 13.7% in 1970 to just 5.7% today, only 4.7% of new privately subsidized units went to African Americans. Meanwhile, 56% of the city-county’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-jail-inmates-56-black-4744799.php&quot;&gt;jail inmates&lt;/a&gt; are black.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“It is the best first step that we have,” Supervisor Malia Cohen had said at the time, saying it “was not the perfect solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;HUD’s decision will have an immediate impact on those seeking affordable housing. Because of its dependence on federal funding, local residents will no longer receive preference in the lottery for the Willie B. Kennedy development at the Turk and Webster intersection in the Western Addition, a 98-unit senior housing development. The Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, the non-profit developer that plans to open the project in the fall, received $15.2 million from the federal agency, which will also subsidize rents exceeding 30% of future residents’ income.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supervisor London Breed, a native of the Western Addition who was raised in public housing, described it as a “devastating blow” to San Francisco’s black population. “I’m not giving up that easy,” she added in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LondonBreed/status/765936705559855104&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;We reported last month that Los Gatos would be facing a contentious decision on a mixed-use apartment development in the North 40 area, at the intersection of two highways. Last night, the Los Gatos Town Council voted to postpone thei decision on the 320-unit project until September.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Spearheaded by Eden Housing and SummerHill Homes, the dwelling units come as part of a broader development by Grosvernor Americas which would also include 66,381 square feet of retail space and open, walkable plazas decorated with local flora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Councilmember Marcia Jensen urged an unsuccessful motion to approve the project. She cited the region’s dire need for new housing, mentioning both Kate Downing’s recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://shift.newco.co/letter-of-resignation-from-the-palo-alto-planning-and-transportation-commission-f7b6facd94f5#.g3y6hlb57&quot;&gt;resignation&lt;/a&gt; from the Palo Alto Planning Commission, as well as local litigation group &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlaef.org/&quot;&gt;CaRLA&lt;/a&gt;’s threat to sue under the Housing Accountability Act.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” she argued. “That’s a subjective standard.” She later reminded the audience, “we all live in houses that used to be an orchard.” She also delivered scathing rebuttals to those who scoffed at the threat of litigation. “Lots of you said, 'don't worry about litigation, we'll deal with that.' …Threatening to sue is not bullying,” she insisted. “Bullying is being called a murderer in a town council meeting. Bullying is getting cars broken into and trashed.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Jensen seemed to be fully aware that her unpopular opinion could face blowback. “I recognize that saying what I'm saying now, there are personal consequences to that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Despite the controversy, a contesting motion by Mayor Barbara Spector to deny approval of the project also failed to pass. After further discussion, the mayor expressed her primary concern to be the cost of market-rate rentals, not the density, and suggested she could support the project if it included Below Market Rentals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Eventually a motion to delay the decision did pass, on the condition that Los Gatos would consult with the California Department of Housing &amp;amp; Community Development on the city’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abag.ca.gov/planning/housingneeds/pdfs/comments/6-21-12%20RHNA%20Comments_Los%20Gatos.pdf&quot;&gt;Regional Housing Needs Allocation&lt;/a&gt;, and study the “economics” of the situation. The project is expected to return before the council in September.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;San Jose’s City Council voted yesterday to approve a temporary modular housing project on Evans Lane, amid vocal criticism in support of a permanent alternative. The proposal passed by an 8-3 vote, with Pierluigi Oliverio, Manh Nguyen and Johnny Khamis opposed in the dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The site on Evans lane lies in the Willow Glen neighborhood of South San Jose, just off the Almaden Expressway. Oliverio (pictured above), whose district covers the site, insisted that he would prefer to see high-density apartments built on the 6 acres of city-owned land. He stated that “housing 1,000 people in the long term versus 102 people in the short term is the better option,” adding that the temporary project would worsen problems in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almaden Expressway, San Jose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;There will be 102 temporary modular homes in the approved project, which could house at least two people each, as opposed to the 446 permanent units in the alternative proposal. Staff emphasized that only half of the 446 would be “affordable.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;City staff recommended the temporary modular units, provided by non-profit developers Abode Servoces, on the basis of greater financial feasibility and more immediate relief in the midst of the city’s shelter crisis. Abode’s project would cost $15 million in city funds and open in the summer of 2017 until 2032; the previous permanent proposal would be completed in 2022 and cost $109 million, with city funds leveraged with state and federal subsidies. Oliverio objected to this projection in moving to pass the permanent alternative, suggesting that many developers would be interested in building o”n the site, “by my discussions, faster than the timeline staff has provided.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In their presentation, city staff urged the council to not consider the alternatives to be at cross purposes. “If you approve this…we will continue to build permanent affordable housing,” said city housing director Jacky Morales-Ferrand. In staff’s assessment, the interim housing would merely “prep them” to move into move into “permanent, supportive” housing after more is built.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Permanent housing for the homeless population, according to staff, “will lag because of need for financing”—moreover, they urged council to view the 102 modular units as an investment in the quality of the neighborhood. Morales-Ferrand spoke of “bringing more amenities” to a neighborhood which she admitted “has been left behind.” The Adobe project will include a dog park, small library and community garden.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A Willow Glen resident speaking in favor of the permanent option described his neighborhood as a proud working-class Latino &amp;amp; Vietnamese community that focused on their families after working long weekday hours. Temporary residents, on the other hand, “would leave after nine months…and if people don’t care about the community, they don’t care about the neighborhood.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Approval came late in the night, with the meeting lasting a total of seven and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Residents will share the site with four case managers and two property managers, and will have 24-hour security. Adobe Services plans on the land from the city for $1 a year, as well as passing on any net profit the project may yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Two mixed-use construction &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/08/mission-district-housing-project-reaches-25-percent-affordable/&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; in the Mission came before the Planning Commission last Thursday, facing a broad spectrum of reactions from the local community. The proposal at 2600 Harrison Street, replacing an empty warehouse with 19 dwelling units and ground-floor industrial space, was largely welcomed. Subsequently, a larger project at 1515 South Van Ness Avenue (pictured above) faced staunch opposition from neighborhood groups, despite an unprecedented 25% of the units reserved for Below Market Rentals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Supporters speaking in favor of 2600 Harrison noted that it could be a strong catalyst for the city’s languishing Small Sites Acquisition Program, with the potential to “preserve the existing fabric of the community.” Rather than including on-site Below Market Rental units, the developer will be providing $1.1 million to the city’s program, which buys existing buildings to protect tenants living in affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Commission vice-president Dennis Richards noted how unusual the tenor of this particular hearing was. “I think this is a great project. I never thought I’d see people from this part of town get up and talk about their support of this project.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Local activists cited the project as a model for how neighbors and developers could better collaborate in the future. “This is the kind of process we’d like to see,” said Peter Papadopolous of the Cultural Action Network. In contrast, Cultural Action Network had previously coalesced in opposition to a much larger project at &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2016/06/after-years-of-delay-bryant-street-housing-project-moves-forward/&quot;&gt;2000 Bryant Street&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Papadopolous and Erick Arguello, president of Calle 24, were more lukewarm in their reception of the 157-unit project at 1515 South Van Ness, saying they needed more time to negotiate with the developer. Arguello insisted that local stakeholders wanted to see the Below Market Rental allotment ideally raised to 30-35%. Yet supporters noted that the developer, Lennar Corporation, had made the unprecedented move of offering 25%. “This project has the highest level of affordable housing on-site that we’ve seen,” Commissioner Rich Hills stated. In his estimation, no project had reserved a greater proportion of permanently affordable units without government subsidies or zoning changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Previous community negotiations had nearly doubled the percentage from an earlier 13.5%. Local residents in opposition still bemoaned that the new units would “change the demographic” of the Mission District. The project now offers 25% Below Market Rentals even though it was grandfathered into the earlier 12% requirement, before the passage of Proposition C.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A local resident who grew up a block away from the project said it would be “fantastic” to see a “beautiful” structure at the site. He described the location as consisting of three gas stations and a phone-booth bar during his childhood. Another supporter urged the commission to approve the project because of an existing agreement to use all-union labor for construction.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Opponents in the neighborhood insisted that the provision of new market-rate construction would only further drive out the area’s poor minority residents. Scott Feeney, a Mission resident who supported the project, countered this concern: “Where are those rich people going to live if they don’t have a new apartment to move into?” he asked. “The obvious answer is…they’re going to have to look at older housing stock. By doing that, they drive up prices of old apartments that were once relatively affordable to the middle class.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“I’m not going to have anything in common with the rich people living right down the street, one speaker insisted. (Another speaker supporting the project offered to meet with her afterwards to find things they had in common.) In bemoaning the changing demographics of the area, the speaker summed up the ongoing economic debate: “Don’t call it market-rate. In San Francisco, market-rate is luxury housing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Members of Calle 24 insisted that the project had the potential to disrupt the newly designated Latino Cultural District, intended to preserve legacy Latino businesses. “We believe it can be better,” Arguello noted in asking for a continuance.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Despite these demands, the planning commission unanimously approved both projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;On warm summer days in the Bay Area, one can often hear an onlooker remark, while gazing at the shimmering clear sky, “this is what we pay exorbitant rents for—this perfect weather.” In 2088, another major industry may be making the same overtures toward San Francisco: the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;UK medical journal The Lancet’s recently published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616313356&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, “The last Summer Olympics? Climate change, health, and work outdoors” seeks to evaluate which major cities around the globe could withstand global warming enough to host the 2088 Olympics. Researchers Kirk Smith of UC Berkeley, Alistair Woodard, and other global health scientists paint a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcodesign.com/3062819/the-list-of-cities-that-could-host-the-2086-olympics-is-very-very-short&quot;&gt;grim picture&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, San Francisco is the only city whose climate could support outdoor athletic competitions during the daytime.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The paper assumes that the International Olympic Committee would not want to host the events where there would be a 10% or higher chance that games must be cancelled to avoid heat stroke or death. (The research limits itself to the Northern Hemisphere due to its greater concentration of the world's population.) Only Calgary, Vancouver, and San Francisco would qualify in North America. Asia would only have two worth the risk: the capital cities of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, and Ulanbataar, Mongolia. By the 2100s, the only suitable cities left would be Belfast, Dublin, Edinburgh, and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The paper also points to the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/races/2007-chicago-marathon-melt-down&quot;&gt;“meltdown”&lt;/a&gt; of the aborted 2007 Chicago Marathon, in which 185 runners were raced to hospitals, and one contestant died. Kirk, Woodart et al insist this is evidence the patterns they predict are already well underway.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;More alarming is what researchers call the “pernicious impact” of climate change: overwhelming detriments for labor and the world’s poorest populations. Half of the world’s population works outside during the daytime, and Smith predicts that necessary changes in daytime behavior will be met with strong resistance from bosses trying to streamline productivity. “Increasingly,” the researchers write, “people will face a choice between doing what they have done for millions of years—work hard outdoors essentially any time they wish—and being safe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Housing for teachers has been a central issue since the onset of the Bay Area’s latest affordability crisis. Jill Tucker of the San Francisco Chronicle &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/education/article/SF-public-schools-start-year-a-few-teachers-short-9144344.php?t=980da7d443e5bced66&amp;amp;cmpid=email-premium&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that San Francisco faces a shortage of 38 teachers at the opening of this school year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Although retirements and resignations have dropped overall since 2015, sudden departures in the last few weeks have forced the city’s school system to scramble to fill staff openings. Despite the dire situation, Superintendent Richard Carranza spoke of a “huge” success in concentrating staffing efforts in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods. As a result, Martin Luther King, Jr. Middle School in Portola will be fully staffed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The Learning Policy Institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/our-work/publications-resources/addressing-californias-emerging-teacher-shortage-an-analysis-of-sources-and-solutions/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that California is at a 12-year low point in teacher hiring.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;While San Francisco has begun offering major signing bonuses to new candidates, the City of Oakland, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://oaklandnorth.net/2016/03/03/recruitment-fair-hopes-to-engage-new-teachers-addressing-oakland-teacher-shortage/&quot;&gt;also faces&lt;/a&gt; a teacher shortage, has been searching for Spanish and bilingual educators in Spain and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Bay Area residents love voting for elected office, and the BART Board of Directors elections are no exception. After District 9 Director Tom Radulovich announced two weeks ago that he would not be running for reelection, the BART Board race became a free-for-all among non-incumbents. Lisa Feldstein’s recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LisaforBART/status/764288963846615040&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; departure from the race leaves two candidates: former Supervisor Bevan Dufty, and local activist Michael Petrelis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Observers have noted that this will be the second time Petrelis will appear on a ballot instead of running as a write-in candidate, which he did in last year’s mayoral election. Petrelis, who was previously on the ballot in opposition to Supervisor Scott Wiener of District 8 (and was served a &lt;a href=&quot;http://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/san-francisco-blogger-in-bathroom-flap-ordered-to-stay-away-from-wiener/Content?oid=2319109&quot;&gt;restraining order&lt;/a&gt; against Wiener), often posts findings from frequent Freedom Of Information Act requests on his blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;The Petrelis Files&lt;/a&gt;. He faces strong opposition from Dufty, whose broad name recognition led to Feldstein dropping out of the race. Feldstein had previously been endorsed by Radulovich when he announced he would not be running.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Petrelis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“Bevan is going to win,” Petrelis stated bluntly over the phone. “I’ve been friends with him for years. Both of us will run a positive, issues-oriented campaign.  I will not be raising money—I will be running a ‘DIY Democracy’ campaign. I will be campaigning only at the 16th Street BART station.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In his view, the 16th Street BART Plaza embodied the many shortcomings of the entire BART system. The plaza “speaks to terrible tenure of incumbent Radulovich,” he said. “These plazas have been sanitary hazards for years. You can find so much debris next to the escalator, it’s a fire hazard. The steps on both entrances are filthy—it doesn’t seem like there’s any maintenance of the entrances.  Two years ago, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2014/06/dpw-cleans-up-bart-plaza-bird-poop-dph.html&quot;&gt;got&lt;/a&gt; BART and the Department of Public Works to steam-clean those plazas and to install anti-bird wiring to reduce pigeon poop.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Petrelis later referred us to his additional &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2015/06/barts-major-changes-coming-to.html&quot;&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; in restocking elevator signage at the station. In deference to Dufty, he also spoke of his goals to increase public engagement with the Board of Directors. “I want the BART Board to hold evening meetings—currently they only meet at 9 AM—and listening sessions at the stations. My strength is going to be coordinating with Bevan to promote these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;After his tenure on the Board of Supervisors, Dufty served as Mayor Ed Lee’s “homeless czar” before abruptly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Dufty-out-as-homeless-czar-deputy-to-take-6567096.php&quot;&gt;resigning&lt;/a&gt; in late 2015. As the point person for city policy on homelessness, he spearheaded beleaguered &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfpublicpress.org/news/2014-10/promise-of-supportive-housing-for-homeless-faces-reality-of-short-supply&quot;&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; to increase the number of shelter beds and supportive housing options.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Supervisor Bevan Dufty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When reached by phone, Dufty spoke with pride about establishing the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionlocal.org/2015/01/new-center-to-navigate-homeless-to-homes/&quot;&gt;navigation centers&lt;/a&gt; for the homeless in San Francisco. “People recognize that the navigation centers are successful because they meet people where they are. People on the streets have partners, pets, possessions… The way shelters have been established in SF, with minimal storage, forces people to choose between their loved ones and a shelter bed. They’re so grateful to go to a place where they don’t go through a metal detector, where they don’t feel like they’re in a prison, and can come and go as they please. These things are not rocket science, but they are revolutionary in addressing homelessness.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;He spoke approvingly of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Jeff-Kositsky-named-1st-director-of-SF-s-new-7462762.php&quot;&gt;Jeff Kositsky&lt;/a&gt;, the Director of the newly-formed Department of Homelessness and Supportive Services. He described Kositsky’s position as a consolidation of disparate agencies he felt had been plagued by a rigid “silo-ism” and non-collaboration. “I left because I had been concerned about some of the public utterances made about not wanting to see seeing homeless people when attending the Super Bowl. I feel like it helped push the issue, and the city created a new Department that consolidated all the services. I fought to create that position, and I think Jeff is doing a great job.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Dufty described the Board of Directors seat as an opportunity to continue his efforts to improve public transit in San Francisco. Noting the upcoming $3 billion bond for BART on the November ballot, he praised the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2016/news20160609&quot;&gt;bond measure&lt;/a&gt; as necessary for updating BART’s train control system—the most antiquated in the region, after he helped replace the control system on MUNI.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;He also insisted that there was a dire need to improve public safety at BART stations.  In his view, his unanimous endorsement by the San Francisco Labor Council made him uniquely qualified to foster good relations between labor, management, and riders. “BART has a police department that sadly is known because of the tragic killing of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfbayview.com/2015/02/centuries-of-rage-the-murder-of-oscar-grant-iii/&quot;&gt;Oscar Grant&lt;/a&gt;, so having a strong community policing approach that is welcoming to all of our patrons and really creates safety is of paramount importance to me. And there has to be accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Dufty and District 7 candidate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lateefahforbart.com/&quot;&gt;Lateefah Simon&lt;/a&gt; have mutually endorsed each other. San Franciscans, he said, have “the opportunity to elect two very strong directors, in myself and Lateefah Simon.” He described him and Petrelis as &quot;colleagues&quot; who agreed on many things, but disagreed just as often in pursuit of better policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When serving as Supervisor during the last economic recession, Dufty also supported &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfpublicpress.org/news/2010-05/supervisors-support-fee-deferrment-to-encourage-building-in-the-city&quot;&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 to defer the collection of development fees until after completing construction.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Dufty presented an overarching goal of expanding access of services across the class divide. “Too many people that have the things we should be grateful for don’t really like to see the people who need services and resources actually getting them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;He had no comment to offer on the cancellation of Feldstein’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Sunnyvale will be holding a special election tomorrow to fill the vacant City Council seat of David Whittum, who resigned on April 4. Under the city charter, Whittum’s unexpected resignation forces the city to create a special election independent of statewide or municipal elections because his vacancy was declared more than 180 days before the November election. Whittum would have had to retire later than April 12 for the elections to be consolidated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sunnyvale’s City Council &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_29792766/sunnyvale-election-vacant-council-seat-will-cost-city&quot;&gt;lamented&lt;/a&gt; the additional cost incurred by Whittum’s timing: rather than simply adding another entry on the ballot, the city will spend $767,000 to elect a replacement, who will then have to run again in November to retain the position. Councilmember Pat Meyering cast the sole vote against the special election, further asking the city attorney if they could appoint an interim councilmember. Sunnyvale does have precedent for an interim appointment, when Mayor Otto Lee took leave of the council to serve a military tour in Iraq, but the city attorney insisted that this did not apply because Lee had not resigned.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Three &lt;a href=&quot;http://votersedge.org/ca/en/ballot/election/area/41/contests/contest/11399?election_authority_id=43&quot;&gt;candidates&lt;/a&gt; have stepped up to fill the vacancy: John Cordes, Larry Klein, and Stephen Williams. These candidates have significant overlap in their policy positions, particularly regarding Transit-Oriented Development.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://larryforcouncil.com/&quot;&gt;Klein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.john4sunnyvale.org/why-i-am-running.html&quot;&gt;Cordes&lt;/a&gt;, both engineers, have called for easing zoning restrictions to encourage backyard Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), known colloquially as “granny flats.” Their platforms also make mention of reducing minimum square footage for apartment units to encourage more dense development, particularly along transit corridors.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Klein, who currently serves as President of the Sunnyvale Historical Society, cites the completion of Sunnyvale’s Town Center as a top priority. Williams also notes his efforts to increase the availability of entry-level jobs in the area. While all three candidates voice support for bike and pedestrian infrastructure to reduce traffic, as well as increased shuttle services to the Caltrain station, Cordes takes the unique approach of calling for increased traffic impact fees on office construction. As an environmentalist and bicycle advocate, he notes that transportation is the leading source of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the country. Cordes further calls for a reduction of dependency on imported water, and providing renewable energy to through the Silicon Valley Clean Energy Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://innovatesunnyvale.org/&quot;&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt;, a self-employed software engineer, urges a more thorough approach to car-alternative infrastructure. “[T]o tie together our disjoint city,” he calls not only for a free rapid shuttle service to connect neighborhoods to transit and commercial centers, but also “pedestrian highways” that would include pedicab service.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;All three candidates cite strong support for a local rent control ordinance, which Sunnyvale currently lacks. While all of them cite “affordable housing” as a priority, Klein wades into the weeds of specificity by explicitly calling for an increase in the Below Market Rate requirement for new multifamily for-sale units, from 12.5% to 15%.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Members of the Chinatown community gathered in Portsmouth Square last Wednesday to discuss the growing number of vacancies and the increasing economic hardship in the area. The square itself lies in the shadow of the Empress of China - a six story neighborhood landmark that has stood unoccupied for the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by a newly founded community organization known as Treehouse Space, the event was centered on a recent visual survey that discovered a total of 46 vacant storefronts along the neighborhood’s main streets.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;“These storefronts are the first signs of a kind of neglect,” Alfred Twu said. Twu (pictured, center) is an artist at Treehouse Space, who highlighted the cultural importance of the area, saying that it was place where he could really connect with his heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Jenny Chan, the founder of Treehouse Space, was focused on solutions. “We just all need to come together and sit together to solve this issue,” she said, calling for the creation of “a ten year plan for the growth and revitalization of this neighborhood.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;According to a Chinatown resident who spoke at the event, the current plan for the area is almost 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Oakland’s Design Review Committee met at City Hall to pass recommendations for a 22-story apartment building &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca1/groups/ceda/documents/agenda/oak059812.pdf&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; by Boston Properties. One of the country’s largest office landlords, Boston Properties, has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2016/08/boston-properties-oakland-tower-temescal-bxp.html?ana=twt&quot;&gt;partnered&lt;/a&gt; with local developer McGrath Properties to develop several mixed-use high-rises by the MacArthur BART station.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Amid vociferous opposition from several mostly older residents, the two-person subcommittee of the Planning Commission suggested using lighter-colored glass and staggering one façade to create &quot;a more residential feel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- END text-block --&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artist rendering of MacArthur Transit Village as viewed from street level&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;For many speakers at the hearing, the proposal was simply too tall, a few stories taller than the nearby Kaiser Permanente building. Several neighbors feared shadows would plunge their homes into darkness, even after representatives of Boston Properties pointed out that the design was specifically intended to cast as little of a shadow as possible on surrounding residences.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;(Full disclosure: this author spoke in favor of the shade it would provide for commuters waiting at the Emery-Go-Round shuttle stop.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A newer resident, who had bought a home in Temescal after The Mission had become to expensive, summed up these concerns: “I think we need to look at the design…it’s too big, it’s too tall, let’s bring it back home.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;But an older resident of 45 years in Oakland thought it was just right: “height is the future,” she said. Another local resident, a 24-year old employed by Boston Properties, echoed this optimism: “This is the future of Oakland,” he insisted. “Nobody knows what the future looks like…I want to live in this building. All my friends, when we talk about it, they want to live in this building.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Despite concerns over the affordability of market-rate units, Commissioner Jahmese Myres spoke approvingly of the 20% of units set aside for Below Market Rate rents. She noted in her comments that this was a far greater percentage than anything that had come to the commission previously.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Height-averse neighbors continued to point to a reduced proposal from 2010, when an entitled project on the parcel downsized from 15 to 8 stories, as a model for potential compromise. “We don’t want to come here and litigate this again,” one resident said ominously.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Ultimately tensions split over whether the building was appropriate—even necessary—for Oakland’s future, or whether the city’s growth should be spread less conspicuously across other neighborhoods. “I want to see a similar building at West Oakland BART, which is my station,” one supporter suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Other supporters spoke of a “moral obligation” to encourage as much new housing as possible in the area: one was a mother holding her infant in her arms, while neighbor Tomasso Sciortino spoke of the sacrifices his Sicilian parents made after moving to the United states.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Max Allstadt, a local carpenter and homeowner of 13 years, decried what he saw as the “classism and selfishness” of fellow property owners “opposing housing during a crisis.” He questioned how a local lawyer could claim to have afforded building a second story on his own home, and subsequently speak against additional stories for new homes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When reached by phone, Allstadt offered additional comments about the meeting: “I’ve been advocating for more housing in Oakland for the better part of a decade. Until today I’ve never seen this many people from so many different backgrounds turn out to support a project, ever. This is unprecedented. A tide has turned.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Deliberations are far from over for the project. At adjournment, an attendee began berating city staff for what they considered a lack of public engagement, and the clerk reminded the audience that this was merely the first of at least three hearings. The MacArthur Transit Village will soon be going before the full Planning Commission in October.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco resident John Eng filed a class action &lt;a href=&quot;http://millenniumlitigation.com/documents/claim/&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; yesterday against Millennium Partners and the Transbay Joint Powers Authority. The lawsuit alleges that both the real estate developer and the public agency wrongfully deferred responsibility in allowing the notorious Millennium Tower to deteriorate into its current &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf.curbed.com/2016/8/2/12358036/millennium-sf-sinking-tilting-building&quot;&gt;(literally)&lt;/a&gt; sinking situation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;A geotechnical engineer hired by the developer delivered even worse news than what the Chronicle broke last week: the 58-story condo tower is sinking at a rate of one inch per year, with no potential of slowing. The tower is also tilting 15 inches to its northwest. Some owners have begun reporting cracking walls, water leaks, and uneven floors.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit points out that the tower was built on a former landfill, but unlike neighboring towers, did not have its foundation secured to the underlying bedrock. To worsen the situation, the Transbay authority dug a 60-foot hole next to it to serve as the foundation for the planned Transbay Transit Center. A buttressing system built in 2010 did not help.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Eng, a condo owner in the tower, brings his class action suit on behalf of his neighbors on the grounds that negligence from both parties has irrevocably undermined the value of their investments. Although all the condominium owners are entitled to just compensation under the California Constitution, the claim argues that the “only potential sales transactions that are likely to occur will be all cash by aggressive speculators at deeply discounted prices.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;If and when the units in the building are resold, there has been no report on assessed values, and whether or not the tower will simply be demolished. According to the filing, some owners have ceased to pay HOA dues, while others have simply abandoned the property to the lenders.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;In a scathing &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@katevershovdowning/letter-of-resignation-from-the-palo-alto-planning-and-transportation-commission-f7b6facd94f5#.4kmbik8zy&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the Palo Alto City Council and mayor, Planning and Transportation Commissioner and renter Kate Vershov Downing announced that her family would be relocating to Santa Cruz due to the high cost of housing. She and her husband rent a home with another couple that is valued at $2.7 million. Divided into mortgage payments higher than $12,000 per month, the cost would make it impossible for the attorney and software engineer to raise a family. And so, they will leave.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Downing has been a vocal proponent of increasing the housing supply in Palo Alto, and is the founder of the nonprofit advocacy group &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paloaltoforward.com/&quot;&gt;Palo Alto Forward&lt;/a&gt;. She founded the group in August of 2014, when she noticed other fellow tenants speak at the City Council in favor of a General Plan that would allow for more housing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In her letter, she delivers a blistering critique of the city’s inability to prioritize economic diversity over neighborhood character. “Over the last 5 years I’ve seen dozens of my friends leave Palo Alto and often leave the Bay Area entirely. I’ve seen friends from other states get job offers here and then turn them down when they started to look at the price of housing,” she laments.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;She is further skeptical that the few wealthy elites who could afford Palo Alto homes could sustain the communal character of its social environment. Of the status quo, she writes, “Palo Alto’s streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable. A once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downtown Palo Alto (stock photo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;When reached by phone, Downing elaborated on her decision to move based on the emerging, anachronistic character of Palo Alto. “People who bought houses here in the 60s and 70s think of themselves as middle class because they don’t consider their house part of their wealth. They may have paid $100,000 for it and now they’re sitting on a $3 million property. Then they’ll argue that new housing is just for the rich, that it won’t help affordability. A lot of it is about the quality of life here—‘how quickly can I find a parking spot? How much traffic is there? But it’s not focused on, ‘can people afford to live here? Can I walk to where I go? Is Downtown vibrant?’ It’s all about ‘how quickly can I get in and out with my car.’”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In her view, Palo Alto did not have sustainable goals for the future to make it an appealing place to live. “You look at communities and how they see themselves in the future, their vision: in Mountain View, Redwood City, they’re growing. They’re trying to come up with creative ways to move forward. In Palo Alto, we’re not trying to come up with creative ways; we’re coming up with ways to stop all growth. We’re trying to find ways to stop all growth, to go back to the 1970s. That’s not the kind of community I want to live in.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;She expressed further frustration when discussing her two years on the Planning and Transportation Commission: “I haven’t seen an actual housing project—that is, just housing—be proposed in the last 2 years. The building regulations, the parking regulations, all of it is so uninviting that people don’t even bother. The only housing we see being added is part of limited mixed-use development. They do two floors of office spaces, one floor of penthouses and they call that housing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Downing was quick to point out that although she could afford a home relatively nearby, she chose to speak about her situation because the plight of lower-income workers was so much worse. “I’m extraordinarily privileged,” she said. “I have lots of options: I can move, I can change jobs, and it’s not an issue. What’s clear is that if people like me can’t afford to be in Palo Alto, there are so many people out there who don’t have these kinds of choices.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto is one of many places in Silicon Valley where even 3 hour commutes have been reported for lower-income workers.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Downing announced in her letter that she would be moving to Santa Cruz, where the median home price is $800,000. In Palo Alto, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zillow.com/palo-alto-ca/home-values/&quot;&gt;Zillow&lt;/a&gt; reports a median price of $2.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Last Friday evening, three cyclists of the bikepocalypse rode along an Acheron of asphalt toward the pedestrian hell at 6th &amp;amp; Mission. There is no hyperbole here: 24 people have been killed by cars in San Francisco so far this year. Over the past 7 years, 126 pedestrians have been killed in traffic collisions, along with 20 cyclists. The anonymous activists &lt;a href=&quot;http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/08/08/spurred-by-s-f-cyclist-deaths-guerrilla-safe-streets-activists-take-action/&quot;&gt;told KQED&lt;/a&gt; they were there to enforce the city’s Vision Zero plan, the goal to have no traffic fatalities by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Armed with a trailer of orange traffic cones, the activists strategically marked off the turns where impatient drivers may not see pedestrians. They also placed cones marking off the bike lane at Golden Gate Avenue, where &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfist.com/2016/06/29/video_man_on_motorcycle_attacks_cyc.php&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; had recently surfaced of cyclists enforcing the lane themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Transportation activists have &lt;a href=&quot;http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/06/23/two-san-francisco-cyclists-killed-in-hit-and-run-crashes/&quot;&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; local officials for what they see as a faltering commitment to street safety after two cyclists were killed by hit-and-run drivers on a single day in June. The activists at 6th &amp;amp; Mission last week are calling themselves the San Francisco Transformation Agency (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SFMTrA&quot;&gt;SFMTrA&lt;/a&gt;, playing on the Metropolitan Transit Agency acronym).&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Today’s redundant aphorism: in cities, people want to go places. Faster, more efficiently, and spending less money. Amid a surging economy and rapid regional population growth, San Francisco has taken varied approaches to improving the mobility of its citizens, both physically and economically.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;The city is not alone in its struggle. Earlier this week, liberal darling economist Paul Krugman penned a New York Times op-ed entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/opinion/time-to-borrow.html&quot;&gt;“Time To Borrow,”&lt;/a&gt; a clarion call for government deficit spending that reads as a pitch-perfect revival of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics&quot;&gt;Keynesian&lt;/a&gt; economic policy. His argument is simple: spend now, while debt is cheap; invest in infrastructure, because it pays for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Krugman’s diagnosis of our current-day infrastructure may resonate with workers who have heard executives describe “technical debt” in companies and propose plans to pay it down. (Full disclosure: such was the situation of yours truly, just a few months ago.) But demand for urban infrastructure is not homogeneous, and local governments must often grapple with competing interests when developing public transit.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;San Francisco is seeing mounting tension between the demand for public mass transit and unencumbered road space for private vehicles, with policy debates around ride-sharing apps inhabiting a vast and murky middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;text-block&quot;&gt;
	
	
	

  
    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the Board of Supervisors &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-approves-agreement-caltrain-electrification/&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; an additional $20 million to electrify rails for Caltrain, the once-an-hour diesel-powered train that connects the city with Peninsula suburbs and San Jose. The decision stands in stark contrast to the priorities of Atherton, an exclusive San Mateo County suburb that has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Anti-high-speed-rail-groups-sue-over-Caltrain-6071826.php&quot;&gt;sued Caltrain&lt;/a&gt; and the state’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_22688893/california-high-speed-rail-finally-wins-peninsula-lawsuit&quot;&gt;High Speed Rail&lt;/a&gt; agency over electrification issues. Atherton is also home to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/maps&quot;&gt;highest Average Annual Household Carbon Footprint&lt;/a&gt; in the state, and one of the highest in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, thousands flocked to San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park for the annual Outside Lands Festival. Many concertgoers who elected to drive or hail a ridesharing service incurred &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfexaminer.com/traffic-tickets-price-surges-hit-uber-lyft-drivers-outside-lands/&quot;&gt;stiff traffic penalties&lt;/a&gt; from SFMTA, and ridesharing giant Uber cashed in on high demand with significant surge pricing. (Its lead competitor, Lyft, claimed to have satisfied demand for drivers without needing to hike prices.) Despite woes for drivers, Muni saw an increased ridership of 3,000 compared to last year’s Outside Lands, as officials estimate over 68,000 took the public transit service to the festival.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other parts of the city seek to make further concessions to cars. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/nevius/article/Closing-Stockton-Street-won-t-be-a-walk-in-the-9130120.php?t=7c85327209e5bced66&amp;amp;cmpid=email-premium&quot;&gt;Debate&lt;/a&gt; has ignited over plans to turn Stockton Street into a pedestrian mall, prohibiting cars in the area surrounding Union Square. Chinatown socialite Rose Pak has stepped in to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Rose-Pak-flashes-red-light-on-Stockton-Street-9126204.php&quot;&gt;oppose&lt;/a&gt; the plan, corralling local business owners who fear added traffic inconveniences to potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    
  
    
				&lt;p&gt;In the Mission District, a vocal coalition of local retailers appears to have won &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfist.com/2016/08/09/sfmta_willing_to_revoke_mission_str.php&quot;&gt;concessions&lt;/a&gt; limiting the red bus lanes on Mission Street between 14th and 30th—where SFMTA reports an 85% drop in Muni collisions. Some of the more conspicuous changes will be rolled back, including forced right turns on Mission Street in the northbound direction.&lt;/p&gt;
